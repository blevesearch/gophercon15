SUMMARY:Starting with the Yocto Project
DESCRIPTION: <p>Yocto has an alleged steep learning curve. It can be a challenge for modules and evaluation board manufacturers to add support for their devices in Yocto as they don't necessarily have a software background. This talk will highlight the steps required, techniques and good practices to create a well integrated machine configuration allowing to build images using the Yocto Linux build system. The Crystalfontz support from meta-fsl-arm-extra will be used to illustrate the talk.</p>

SUMMARY:Software isolation issues
DESCRIPTION: <p>For the development of openconnect VPN server a decision to compartmentalize the server was taken, in order to protect any sensitive values exchanged, ranging from the user transferred data, to the data used during the authentication process.This talk will summarize the issues faced during that development that relate to software isolation. That would cover issues with protecting the server's keys via TLS, the client-side authentication of TLS, and PAM authentication, and how they were solved (or not).</p>

SUMMARY:Go at CoreOS
DESCRIPTION: <p>At CoreOS, we chose to write everything in Go at a time when Python was the language of choice for Linux distributions. It had been almost 10 years since a new Linux distro was created. With the entrance of the cloud era, moving deeply into distributed computing based on Linux containers and multi-core machines, we needed a language that would allow our developers to iterate rapidly and create self-contained components that were not tangled in a web of software dependencies on the operating system. Go was the clear choice because it would enable us to build applications quickly and produce standalone binaries.</p><p>With thousands of hours of Go experience, this session will dive into the trenches on Go at CoreOS. It will explore four major projects written in Go: etcd, fleet, rocket and flannel. Attendees will learn tips and tricks for using Go for building and shipping products. Learn the ways Go enables CoreOS to build simple tools to solve a large variety of infrastructure automation tasks, and create high performance components for distributed systems.</p>

SUMMARY:QGIS Tool for Landslide Hazard Assessment
DESCRIPTION: <p>In Southern Kyrgyzstan, large areas are affected by high landslide activity, which regularly results in casualties and economic losses. There have been many efforts in the past and the present to analyze landslide activity in this large data-scarce region. Yet there is a need for creating a system capable of integrating all of the existing information and include the possibility for future updates. Due to the limited funds and multiple end users, minimization of costs and flexible accessibility are requirements for such a system opting for the use of open source software.</p><p>The presented tool has been developed as a QGIS plugin. That way, it is possible to take advantage of the core QGIS functionality and other plugins, e.g. the OpenLayers plugin. The plugin allows the user to access the data on landslides, their triggering and predisposing factors in an easy-to-use way. A typical workflow includes querying landslide and factor data for a certain time period and then assigning them to mapping units for further analysis. Besides data queries, the plugin offers tools for spatial analysis, e.g. finding the highest point of the landslide polygon as an approximation of the landslide main scarp, extension of the standard zonal statistics functionality for the derivation of landslide attributes, pixel- or polygon-based calculation of earthquake influence, etc.</p>

SUMMARY:PixelVault
DESCRIPTION: <p>Protecting the confidentiality of cryptographic keys in the event of partial or full system compromise is crucial for containing the impact of attacks. The Heartbleed vulnerability of April 2014, which allowed the remote leakage of secret keys from HTTPS web servers, is an indicative example. PixelVault is a system for keeping cryptographic keys and carrying out cryptographic operations exclusively on the GPU, which allows it to protect secret keys from leakage even in the event of full system compromise. This is possible by exposing secret keys only in GPU registers, keeping PixelVault’s critical code in the GPU instruction cache, preventing this way even privileged host code from accessing any sensitive code or data.</p><p>Due to the non-preemptive execution mode of the GPU, an adversary that has full control of the host cannot tamper with PixelVault’s GPU code, but only terminate it, in which case all sensitive data is lost. We have implemented a PixelVault-enabled version of the OpenSSL library that allows the protection of existing applications with minimal modifications. Based on the results of our evaluation, PixelVault not only provides secure key storage using commodity hardware, but also significantly speeds up the processing throughput of cryptographic operations for server applications.</p>

SUMMARY:Cache2k, Java caching turbo charged
DESCRIPTION: <p>The development of cache2k has two streams: It is a robust cache implementation and provides features we miss from other products, on the other hand it is a research area to try out new caching algorithms and implementations to achieve the best performing in-memory Java cache that is available today.</p><p>The talk will start with some real-world scenarios and challenges and how the cache can help, making it the pivotal point in an application to manage data resources and provide them on time. The second part of the talk will be about modern and adaptive caching algorithms and why you should not implement yet another "LRU cache" by yourself.</p><p>This talk should encourage to use more caching to speed up applications and, of course, to hack and improve existing caching products. There is still much to achieve!</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>Polygonal meshes are the most common way of representing 2D geometries for simulation purposes. Integrating simulation to a GIS requires  storing georeferenced meshes in a databases (or using standard SIG file formats), and being able to use simulation values interpolated over the elements as a map layer.</p><p>This presentation reviews what is the closest you can get with existing FOSS GIS solutions and what is needed to bridge the gap, both on the simulation side and on the GIS side.</p><p>We show the few lines that need to be added to the simulation code to read a mesh from the GIS and write the results to the GIS. We also present a prototype mesh layer for QGIS that has been implemented as a PluginLayer.</p>

SUMMARY:Thou shalt not leak your keys
DESCRIPTION: <p>The Heartbleed vulnerability made one thing very clear, current TLS stacks lackan efficient way to isolate the cryptographic material from the applicationlayer. Hence, this vulnerability required the massive renewal of private keysand certificates. This sure was a costly and painful process for ITdepartments. The most efficient approach consists of using Hardware SecurityModules or smartcards to store the cryptographic material. Keys remainconfidential while being usable through an API to perform cryptographicoperations.PKCS#11 is a standardized security API that is widely adopted bydevice vendors. However, deployment of such hardware can be costly andinconvenient in many scenarios. We propose using Caml Crush, a PKCS#11filtering proxy, in combination with software PKCS#11 tokens. This architectureleverages process isolation between the TLS stack and the cryptographicmaterial. This low-cost alternative is immediately applicable to PKCS#11compliant software. We demonstrate that this architecture has a low performanceoverhead by benchmarking the impact on web hosting scenarios.</p>

SUMMARY:Using Firefox to debug web apps on any device
DESCRIPTION: <p>Debugging mobile apps in a world of multiple platforms will always be a classic case of "write once, debug everywhere". A monoculture avoids this problem, but brings a boatload of others, so there is really no way around that. Once we come to terms with this fact however, we can start demanding more from the tools that we use to do said debugging. Do we really have to become proficient in a multitude of tools, one for each platform that we intend to deploy on? How often must we context-switch and app-switch in order to get things done?</p><p>The Firefox Developer Tools Adapter presents a unique approach to the aforementioned problem. In this talk we will dive into the design and implementation of the Adapter, explain why it is a valuable addition to the mobile developer's toolchest and discuss how it can be used to solve real-life problems.</p>

SUMMARY:Qucs: overview, status and roadmap
DESCRIPTION: <p>This talk presents Qucs (Quite Universal Circuit Simulator) features, the current status of development and the project roadmap.</p><p>Qucs is an integrated circuit simulator. The graphical user interface (GUI) is used for schematic capture and visualization of simulation results. It can simulate the large-signal, small-signal and noise behavior of the circuit. The software aims to support all kinds of circuit simulation types such as DC, AC, transient, S-parameter, noise analysis, harmonic balance analysis. Digital simulation and circuit optimization are integrated into the GUI and powered by other open-source tools (Icarus-Verilog, freeHDL, ASCO). Besides the library of components it also includes tools for the design of active and passive filters, transmission lines, attenuators and matching circuits. Interfaces for Matlab/Octave and Python are also available.</p><p>The talk will provide an overview of the features and available tools along with a selection of examples. It will present the latest developments including: migration towards the latest Qt framework; new features related to the “turn-key” Verilog-A (ADMS) model compiler as well as support for other simulation engines (ngspice). The project goals are ambitious. This talk aims at presenting what Qucs can offer as well as tease the audience into thinking what is achievable with the open-source EDA tools available today.</p>

SUMMARY:The CHERI CPU
DESCRIPTION: <p>The CHERI research CPU extends the 64-bit MIPS ISA with byte-granularity memory protection.  CHERI enables language memory model enforcement and fault isolation in hardware rather than software.  In contrast to past capability models, CHERI complements, rather than replaces, the ubiquitous page-based protection mechanism, providing a migration path towards deconflating data-structure protection and OS memory management. Furthermore, CHERI adheres to a strict RISC philosophy: it maintains a load-store architecture and requires only single-cycle instructions, and supplies protection primitives to the compiler, language runtime, and operating system.</p><p>This talk will present the CHERI softcore and associated software stack and describe how building on open source has enabled full-stack security research.</p>

SUMMARY:Sustaining the zero assembler port in OpenJDK: An inside perspective of CPU specific issues
DESCRIPTION: <p>OpenJDK comes with a zero assembler port called Zero. Back in 2009 when Zero was originally developed by Gary Benson, OpenJDK was available only on x86, x86_64 and SPARK. Despite recent JIT ports, such as the AArch64 and ppc/aix port, Zero still remains relevant for many Linux distributions. For example, at Red Hat we build and use the OpenJDK zero variant on PPC/PPC64 and s390/s390x. What's more it's a useful tool for getting new JIT ports built from source using free software.</p><p>This talk will give a brief summary what Zero is and how it works. It will cover some of the recently discovered issues with sustaining the Zero port, how we try to catch them early and it will explain our experience with pushingfixes upstream. There will also be examples how this effort benefits the OpenJDK ecosystem as a whole.</p>

SUMMARY:A dedicated kernel named TORO
DESCRIPTION: <p>In systems with high-grade multiprocessing, we have identified two bottlenecks: in the accessing of the memory bus and in the shared resources. To deal with these issues, we propose a dedicated kernel named TORO that is optimized to run a single multi-threading application. TORO is demonstrating an innovative operating system by integrating at the same ring level both kernel and the user application server. In addition, the accessing to resources (e.g., Filesystem, Networking, Memory) is dedicated to specific processor. Then, only the CPU where is dedicated the resource is allowed to access to the instanceof the resource. As a result of this design, the kernel provides direct access to all resources without any overhead, and therefore maximizesperformance for the overall system. To sum-up the approach, in TORO, the threads of the user application server are distributed evenly on all CPUs and running independently in parallel. The memory model chosen is NUMA without pagination. During the initialization, the memory is divided proportionally for each processor installed on the system. When a thread needs memory, the memory allocator returns a free block of memory depending on which CPU the thread is running. In the same way, TORO can dedicate resources to specific processor, i.e., a FileSystem. This only CPU then can access tothis instance of FileSystem. The scheduler is based on the cooperative threading model, therefore due to this design, TORO can migrate threadsbetween CPUs and send messages between threads without using any lock instruction.</p>

SUMMARY:GRASS GIS 7: Efficiently processing big geospatial data
DESCRIPTION: <p>You see beautiful maps every day, you use geospatial data every day but do you know what's behind processing all the big geospatial data? With the advent of open geospatial data in Europe new opportunities arise. In our presentation we show GRASS GIS (Geographic Resources Analysis Support System, http://grass.osgeo.org), a software suite for geospatial data management and analysis, image processing, graphics and map production, spatial modeling, and visualization. The software has been developed as FOSS for more than 30 years by a large community of developers and users.After six years of development and a long beta release cycle the new stable GRASS GIS 7.0 release is imminent. GRASS GIS 7 is rich in functionality, it offers e.g. enhanced vector network analysis, voxel processing, support for massive time series data management, an animation tool for raster and vector map time series, a graphical image classification tool, and a "map swiper" for interactive maps comparison. The software is portable among most operating systems including GNU/Linux, Mac OSX, FreeBSD, AIX, SUN Solaris, other Unix based, and MS-Windows.</p><p>GRASS GIS 7 offers a new Python API (PyGRASS) for rapid development of workflows. For working teams, it supports shared data management on networks. It can be used as a geoprocessing backend for Web Processing Service (OGC WPS). For statistics, it comes with an interface to R statistics.</p><p>In our research context, we use GRASS GIS extensively for massive geospatial data analysis on a high-performance computing system (HPC). In our presentation, we illustrate workflows and results using "EuroLST" temperature dataset (http://gis.cri.fmach.it/eurolst/) as an example of data in the multi-terabyte range.</p>

SUMMARY:First Steps in Receiving Digital Information with RDS/TMC
DESCRIPTION: <p>The Radio Data System (RDS) is a digital subcarrier on ordinary FM radio broadcasts that is used to convey a bunch of information including station name, time, alternate frequencies, and optionally traffic information with the Traffic Message Channel (TMC) protocol.Given its ubiquity, narrow bandwidth demands, and frequency band, RDS might be a good first digital project for SDR newcomers, extending the 'Hello World' of SDR, i.e., the FM receiver.RDS can be received with very cheap hardware like the RTL-SDR and simple antennas making the technology accessible for everybody.</p><p>In this talk, I will give a short introduction in RDS / TMC and present the current state of the GNU Radio RDS project.Besides the receiving part, we will also have a brief look in the transmit side that allows you to create your own small radio station including RDS and TMC messages.The information is hopefully just enough to whet your appetite and helps to get you started.</p>

SUMMARY:LuaRocks - fostering an ecosystem of Lua modules
DESCRIPTION: <p>This talk will present LuaRocks, the package manager for modules for the Lua programming language. Lua has successful as a scripting language embedded into applications, especially in the gaming industry. However, its "no-batteries-included" design prevented it from getting traction as a stand-alone application language.LuaRocks was created to target this problem. This talk will discuss the particular challenges of developing a package manager for Lua. With this project, we've been successfully fostering an ecosystem of extension modules, improving reuse of Lua code.</p>

SUMMARY:IcedTea-Web goes offline and beyond
DESCRIPTION: <p>Future of java applets and javaws is dark. Chrome have already cut down NPAPI. Most of the banks  moved from java to javascript for they internet banking. The javaws will suffer a lot by introducing jigsaw modules. What is remaining? The "physical applets" of course! Seriously - the "killing"  feature of applets is that they do not work offline. But similarly to javaws - they can! IcedTea-Web is now removing this boundaries, and what more, it will also allow you to detach applet out from browser - by jnlp shortcut, or by lunching html page by javaws directly. Apart of this, ITW is now  JDK independent and you can run those features on any OpenJDK, even onOracle or IBM JDKs.And except serving you web application comfortably online, ITW allows you to lock this application - even "signed ones"  in sandbox. And of course there is Jogamp project - the awt-less  plugin - How I wish to see it merged upstream!-)<strong><em> Long story short, more security and much much more freedom </em></strong></p>

SUMMARY:Common Lisp-Style Macroexpansion applied to C
DESCRIPTION: <p>We describe a new free software project, called CGen [name might change], a Ccode generator with support for Common Lisp-style macroexpansion. It is based on a new S-Expression based Syntaxfor C (and C-like languages) which is transcompiled to C(or C-like) code. Our code generator supports the simpleand efficient management of variants, ad hoc codegeneration to capture reoccurring patterns, composableabstractions as well as the implementation of embeddeddomain specific languages by using the Common Lisp macrosystem. We demonstrate the applicability of our approachby numerous examples from small scale convenience macrosover embedded languages to real-world applications inhigh-performance computing.</p><p>After successful presentation at ELS in 2014 we decided topolish our research prototype and make it available asfree software.</p>

U2F specify a USB-based protocol for offloading the private-key handling for strengthening username/password logins, and is supported by Chrome and Google (for gmail.com users) since October 2014.  By using dedicated hardware that require physical presence, issues with common solutions (one-time-password or certs) are improved on.  This talk will be about the U2F protocol, and the free software implementations that we are writing.  There will be hands-on demo of the user-experience and also details about the implementation.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>Software development rarely has "spare" time, which often forces developers to stick to the tools they already know.  Having any sort of learning curve can be a barrier to entry for debugging and performance tools, even when the payoffs are worth the time invested learning new tools.  The Linux Tools Project aims to improve the state of C/C++ development on the Eclipse IDE by integrating popular tools, such as Valgrind.  This integration allows developers to maintain an environment they're familiar with, yet leverage new development tools.</p><p>This talk is aimed at people of varying experience with the Valgrind tool who have never used it within the Eclipse IDE.</p>

SUMMARY:Pseudo GTID and easy replication management
DESCRIPTION: <p>Pseudo GTID and easy replication management</p><p>This session introduces a technique called “Pseudo GTID” which allows easy refactoring of replication topologies, and makes balanced, deeply nested topologies achievable, safe and productive.</p><p>Managing large replication topologies introduces difficult questions: do you place all your slaves directly under the master? Do you setup intermediate masters thus creating deep replication trees? How do you synchronize sibling slaves when their master dies? How do you recover replication of a slave if its intermediate master is gone?</p><p>MySQL’s Global Transaction ID (GTID) comes to solve the above. However GTID comes with its own limitations and not always or not easily applicable.</p><p>Pseudo GTID is a non intrusive solution that utilizes standard replication, and turns your existing replication topology into a GTID-like topology, allowing you to repoint slaves however you like.</p><p>We will quickly discuss the problems incurred by standard binary log file &amp; position setup, and the limitations of GTID, Pseudo-GTID injection. We will present the algorithm and implementation for utilizing Pseudo GTID to freely repoint slaves.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>Ngspice project started in 1999 from the latest implementation of of Berkeley's SPICE3 release. In more than a decade of development it has fixed and upgraded it.  Parallel execution of device code has been implemented to reduce simulation time for transient analysis. Two implementations are available: using OpenMP and CUDA. The KLU solver has been implemented to reduce simulation time of large circuits. Verilog-A models can be included at compile time using the ADMS model compiler.  This presentation will show an overview on the simulator status focusing on the major improvements over the original SPICE3 code.</p>

SUMMARY:From Debian-GIS to OSGeo live and back
DESCRIPTION: <p>Debian GIS is a project with the goal of making Debian the best distribution for Geographical Information System applications.</p><p>OSGeo live (live.osgeo.org) is a self-contained bootable dvd, usb thumb drive or virtual machine based on Lubuntu, that allows you to try a wide variety of open source geospatial software without installing anything. It also contains a set of uniform documentation (description and quickstarts) to guide people around the different projects.</p><p>Even though OSGeo live is based on the packages in Debian, both projects diverted and where OSGeo live managed to get a large (100+) community of contributors, progress in Debian GIS was stalling. Recently however, a new wind is blowing in Debian GIS (among others with the Debian pure blends initiative) and many changes from OSGeo live are being incorporated back into Debian.</p><p>Apart from presenting both projects I will highlight some problems people encounter when they would like to add their package to Debian GIS, and how Debian pure blends try to solve this.</p>

SUMMARY:The Tumbleweed Factory
DESCRIPTION: <p>openSUSE Factory is the head development branch for the openSUSEdistribution releases. As such the explosive mixture of changes andnew versions throughout the whole stack from kernel to the desktopsmade openSUSE Factory a challenging distribution to use even forhard core distribution hackers. To make Factory usable for a wideraudience of distribution developers it had to be made more stablewhile retaining the short turnaround times needed for a bleedingedge distribution. openSUSE therefore introduced a number of automatedand semi-automated tools for review and QA into the developmentworkflow to reach that goal. The result is now called openSUSETumbleweed, a fully rolling binary distribution based on openSUSEFactory. This talk explains the development process and the toolsused to turn openSUSE Factory into Tumbleweed.</p>

SUMMARY:How to create your own Exchange compatible backend
DESCRIPTION: <p>At OpenChange, we work on offering a portable Open Source implementation of Microsoft Exchange Server and Exchange Protocols. During the past 10 years, we have seen the community growing but not the number of developers. The conclusions were clear. The price to pay to develop on OpenChange was too high: C language only, very complex, too much knowledge required, too much time before you get visible results. We have addressed all these obstacles and will teach you during this talk how to set up the development environment in no time, understand the basics of the OpenChange REST API and leverage its resources and samples to get first visible results in Outlook today.</p>

SUMMARY:Moving your Virtual Machines to oVirt with ease
DESCRIPTION: <p>Suppose you want to import virtual machines you already have into oVirt to enjoy a features-rich open sourced management system. You will soon figure out that the conversion of virtual machines running on different hypervisors or managed by different management systems into oVirt is not an easy task. The next major version of oVirt is going to introduce an integrated process that will simplify import of virtual machines not being managed by oVirt into oVirt. This session gives a heads up for the feature: we will go over the design and see how it solves issues that we had before to provide better way for import virtual machines to oVirt.</p>

SUMMARY:A closer look at ARM code quality
DESCRIPTION: <p>A closer look at ARM code quality</p><p>The ARM LLVM backend has been around for many years and generates high quality code, yet there are still standard benchmarks where GCC is generating more efficient code than LLVM.The goal of this talk is to get a better understanding of why the GCC-generated code for those benchmarks is executing more efficiently and also about finding out what we need to do on the LLVM side to address those code generation deficiencies.This talk presents current performance numbers for the SPEC CPU benchmark suites on ARM, comparing the performance of LLVM and GCC, with the main focus on the SPEC CPU integer benchmarks.To dive a little bit deeper, we will also have a closer look at the generated assembly code of selected benchmarks where LLVM is performing worse than GCC and use the results of this performance analysis to point out potential code generation opportunities for LLVM.</p>

SUMMARY:Large-scale graph processing with Apache Flink
DESCRIPTION: <p>Apache Flink (incubating) is a general-purpose platform for batch and streaming distributed data processing. This talk describes how Flink’s powerful APIs, iterative operators and other unique features make it a competitive alternative for large-scale graph processing as well. We take a close look at how one can elegantly express graph analysis tasks, using common Flink operators and how different graph processing models, like vertex-centric, can be easily mapped to Flink dataflows. Next, we get a sneak preview into Flink's upcoming Graph API, which further simplifies graph application development in Flink. Finally, we show how to perform end-to-end data analysis, mixing common Flink operators and the Graph API, without having to build complex pipelines and combine different systems. We will go through a step-by-step example, demonstrating how to perform loading, transformation, filtering, graph creation and analysis, with a single Flink program.</p>

SUMMARY:Open Standards for Big Geo Data
DESCRIPTION: <p>In Geo service terminology, coverages represent spatio-temporally varying phenomena, such as sensor, image, simulation, and statistics data; incidentally, these typically are prime Big Data contributors in practice. The OGC unified coverage model encompasses regular and irregular grids, point clouds, and general meshes. As opposed to the (abstract) coverage model of ISO 19123, the (concrete) OGC coverage and service model establishes verifiable interoperability while still grounding on ISO 19123. The OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS) comprises a modular suite for accessing large coverage assets. WCS Core provides simple data subsetting whereas extensions add optional service facets up to ad-hoc filtering and processing.</p><p>By separating coverage data and service model, any service - such as WMS, WFS, SOS and WPS - can provide and consume coverages in addition to WCS. Generally, the WCS suite is appreciated by implementers due to its clear structuring and concise conformance testing, down to pixel/voxel level. Many WCS implementations are available today, such as rasdaman which has proven efficient on 130+ TB datacubes.</p><p>In our talk, we present the OGC coverage data and service model with an emphasis on practical aspects. Presentation will make use of available services allowing participants to recapitulate many of the facets addressed.</p>

SUMMARY:Zooming in on the New MySQL Group Replication Plugin
DESCRIPTION: <p>MySQL Group Replication is a recent MySQL plugin that brings togethergroup communication techniques and database replication, providingboth a high availability and a multi-master update everywhere replicationsolution.</p><p>At its core is a set of group communication primitives that act as thebuilding blocks to create reliable, consistent and dependable messagingbetween the servers in the group. This allows the set of MySQL serversto coordinate themselves and act as a consistent and replicated statemachine - in which transactions commit in the same order on everyserver. As a consequence, the group itself is fault-tolerant, and sois the service provided by the group - the MySQL database service.</p><p>In addition to HA, the plugin provides multi-master update everywherewith row-level conflict detection. This builds on the fact that theservers in the group have to agree on how to progress the replicatedstate machine and so also check for conflicts.</p><p>Come and learn about the technical details of the exciting and popularMySQL Group Replication plugin and discuss how this fits in the overallpicture of MySQL HA solutions.</p>

SUMMARY:Profiling PHP applications
DESCRIPTION: <p>It's nothing new that speed is important for the success of any web application. Only a few hundred milliseconds may lie between a user leaving your site or staying. Unfortunately performance problems are oftentimes hard to fix and even harder to pinpoint. In this talk I will show you how we at ResearchGate measure web application performance, which means not only timing how long the PHP backend took to deliver a page, but also tracking the speed the users actually perceives in the browser. After that you will see how you can track down and analyze any problems you found through measuring with the help of tools like Xdebug, XHProf and the Symfony Debug Toolbar. And if you still need to get faster after optimizing and fixing all these issues, I'll introduce you to some tricks, techniques and patterns to even further decrease load times.</p>

This talk is about our experiences trying make one of the largest ever external contributions to OpenJDK, the AArch64 port.</p><p>I'll talk about how the OpenJDK contribution process works, and how it doesn't work, and how important it is to gain the trust of people inside Oracle's Java team.  I'll discuss the strange asymmetry of being an external contributor to a project but not being able to know all of what is going on.  I'll try my best to explain the baffling role of Projects and JEPs.  I'll speculate about the future of OpenJDK and how it must change as more people outside Oracle contribute significant slabs of code, and how we must have more external patch reviewers.</p><p>Finally, I'll open up the floor for discussion.  I'm sure we'll have a lot to talk about.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>Deploying containers, images with Docker is becoming a big trend. However, large installations of containerized applications are still few and far between, and solutions are either proprietary or they force you to use their own cloud.</p><p>We believe Foreman can fill this space by providing a central space to provision and manage your containers and your network, as we already do with your data center. This provides a great framework for mixed environments where physical machines, vms, and containers are all used in conjunction. Orchestration through Kubernetes is being implemented at the moment.</p><p>Monitoring, deploying, and everything else is possible to do through the web UI or an API, and it's open source, so if you miss any feature, feel free to add it!</p>

SUMMARY:Rapid GNU Radio GPU Algorithm Prototyping from Python
DESCRIPTION: <p>Theano is an exciting relatively new open source library which was developed by the machine learning community to accelerate the training of Deep Neural networks and other mathematical algorithms built on scipy by generating compiled kernels for the CPU and the GPU using the CUDA compiler and simple python algorithm definitions.   Since GNU Radio provides native python blocks which execute work functions directly on scipy-style input and output vectors joining these two technologies is a magical approach which allows for the extremely rapid definition of work block mathematical kernels, and the automated compilation and offload onto massively parallel graphics processing unit hardware.  By using this approach we will demonstrate how some highly concurrent and computationally expensive algorithms can be implemented extremely concisely and executed efficiently using graphics processors to accelerate GNU Radio channel models and other blocks with minimal effort.For more information on Theano see: http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/pointeurs/theano_scipy2010.pdf and http://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.5590.pdf</p>

SUMMARY:JMAP
DESCRIPTION: <p>For the past 4 years, FastMail has been working on a next generation email protocol for our web interface.  We have years of experience writing email clients and servers, and we know where the pain points are.  This protocol is in production right now, and a 30 second demo will show it in action.</p><p>At the moment the email world is divided.  Every vendor is building their own proprietary JSON protocol, because IMAP+SMTP is a really poor fit for mobile apps and even the LEMONADE protocol changes haven't made the experience good enough.</p><p>We want to change that by offering a completely unencumbered standard which is good enough that companies don't need to build their own, and gain an interoperability layer which is better for everybody.  Raise the baseline experience if you will.  We believe it's possible to have a protocol which is both open AND good.</p>

SUMMARY:Keccak and SHA-3: code and standard updates
DESCRIPTION: <p>In April 2014, the American National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published the draft FIPS 202 standard for the SHA-3 hash functions and the SHAKE extendable-output functions (XOFs), all based on the Keccak sponge function. Since the selection of Keccak as the winner of the SHA-3 cryptographic open competition, NIST announced that they will exploit Keccak's abilities for other purposes than just hashing, including key derivation, pseudo-random bit generation, authentication and (authenticated) encryption.</p><p>A first part of the talk will be to give a summary of the current developments around Keccak and the FIPS 202 standard.</p><p>In the meantime, we have gathered the most efficient implementations of Keccak, SHA-3 hash functions and SHAKE XOFs in the Keccak Code Package. These open source implementations are organized in a way that aims satisfying both the developer of optimized code and the cryptographic user. Central to this organization is a specific internal interface that allows interchangeable optimized codes and a user-friendly set of external services.</p><p>As a second part of the talk, we will briefly present the current status of this development and how the FOSS community can benefit from (and contribute to) this effort.</p><p>This is a follow-up of the talk "Keccak: more than sha3sum" at FOSDEM 2013.</p>

SUMMARY:FOSS CAD for Compact/SPICE Modeling
DESCRIPTION: <p>Compact/SPICE models of circuit elements (passive, active, MEMS, RF) are essential to enable advanced IC design using nanoscaled semiconductor technologies. Compact/SPICE models are also a communication means between the semiconductor foundries and the IC design teams to share and exchange all engineering and design information. To explore all related interactions, we are discussing selected FOSS CAD tools along complete technology/design tool chain from nanascaled technology processes; thru the compact modeling; to advanced IC transistor level design support. New technology and device development will be illustrated by application examples of the FOSS TCAD tools: Cogenda TCAD and DEVSIM. Compact modeling will be highlighted by review topics related to its parameter extraction and standardization of the experimental and measurement data exchange formats. Finally, we will present two FOSS CAD simulation and design tools: ngspice and Qucs. Application and use of these tools for advanced IC design (e.g. analog/RF IC applications) directly depends the quality of the compact models implementations in these tools as well as reliability of extracted models and generated libraries/PDKs. Discussing new model implementation into the FOSS CAD tools (ngspice and Qucs as well as others) we will also address an open question of the compact/SPICE model Verilog-A standardization. We hope that this presentation will be useful to all the researchers and engineers actively involved in the developing compact/SPICE models as well as designing the integrated circuits in particular at the transistor level and then trigger further discussion on the compact/SPICE model Verilog-A standardization and development supporting FOSS CAD tools.</p>

SUMMARY:Effective spelling correction with term relation graphs using Lucene FSTs
DESCRIPTION: <p>Our approach for doing spelling correction has deviated considerably from the default approach Lucene is offering. While Lucene's FuzzyQuery uses a compiled Automaton to filter the dictionary rather efficiently, we directly use normal Automatons and intersect that automaton with a separate FST. This proves to be more efficient for our use case, since it saves memory and time to compile the automaton and also part of the time to identify the matching terms in the dictionary.</p><p>This approach gives us the possibility to store any meta-information with each term, which is used then to pick the top N spellcorrections. We build a term co-occurence graph, where each vertex is a possible spelling correction of a term and each link is the co-occurence in the same document. Each vertex and link get a score based on the meta-information and edit distance. Then we use graph reduction techniques until the graph contains the desired number of spellcorrections.</p>

SUMMARY:MappedByteBuffer.hurray()
DESCRIPTION: <p>Java is a great language for rapid prototyping. For those interested in multimedia and UI design in Linux, however, there are limited options that provide a varying degree of performance and feasibility. It is quite straightforward to perform I/O on a Video 4 Linux device or the Linux framebuffer in C, but not as straightforward in Java. The end result of this project enables Java programmers program devices like the Linux framebuffer much ease as they use byte[] and int[] classes. An interactive demonstration will be made available as part of the workshop. Moreover, the implementation demonstrates speedups of up to 150x in MappedByteBuffer I/O.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>Open Source software can play a critical role for the roll-out of broadcast standards. This is also true for new caption and subtitle standards. The focus on the presentation will be on the OS Subtitle Conversion Framework (SCF). SCF consists of different software modules that aim at a faster and conformant adoption of the EBU-TT standard, an XML based subtitle standard defined by the EBU. Apart from SCF also other OS software that are important for the implementation of subtitles standards will be discussed (e.g. mp4box from GPAC or the WebVTT parser from Anne van Kesteren).</p>

SUMMARY:CockroachDB
DESCRIPTION: <p>Many NoSQL databases come with a focus on performance, availability and scalability, sacrificing strong consistency guarantees along the way. In effect, this shifts the burden of providing consistency to the application, and often results in complex and error-prone application logic.Just a few years ago, an intense effort by Google resulted in Spanner - a globally distributed, replicated datastore that puts transactions back where they belong: right into the heart of the database.</p><p>CockroachDB is a grass-roots effort to bring to the table the guarantees of Spanner (and more) in an open source scalable database that is easy to deploy and, despite the name, quite attractive to have around.In the talk, I'll introduce you to the team behind CockroachDB and the current state of the art, briefly discuss consistency &amp; Spanner and then dive into a tour of what's under the hood.</p>

SUMMARY:Better Devops through Thievery
DESCRIPTION: <p>The advent of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has radically changed how ITinfrastructure is built and maintained. Instead of building and maintainingservers by hand, tools like Puppet can be used to describe and automaticallyconfigure entire data centers.</p><p>The implication of this is that the workflow of IT operations is starting toresemble the workflow of a traditional software developer. Writing code tomake infrastructure changes instead of directly making changes opens up newopportunities for how changes can be made. The software development field hashad 30+ years to learn how to effectively develop code, and their hard wonwisdom can be ripped off wholesale to make it a breeze to develop IaC.</p><p>This talk will discuss the following:</p><ul><li>Using version control tools to more effectively administer infrastructure</li><li>Writing and using tests to confidently make changes and get feedback earlier</li><li>Using continuous integration services to test changes and run deployments</li></ul>

SUMMARY:Manylines
DESCRIPTION: <p>More and more people work with graphs nowadays, but it is not always easy to publish and share the graph interpretation on the web.<strong>Manylines</strong> is a web tool built at Sciences Po médialab to solve this issue.Some researchers and students use network visualizations to explore their data, but networks are not as clear as maps and sharing one’s interpretation is difficult.Manylines main innovation is to allow the user to <strong>explain and share a narrative about his network</strong>: an interactive story where each “slide” is a particular zoom, pan and filtering of the network, completed by a title and description, with fluid transitions like in Prezi.</p><p>Published as an open source prototype with the source code available on GitHub, Manylines is currently built around three screens:- The first screen allows applying the ForceAtlas2 layout to the network, in order to <strong>settle the “basemap”</strong>: the definitive positions of nodes and edges used to support further interpretations.- The second screen allows zooming and filtering the network to explore the data and <strong>“take snapshots”</strong> representing different insights.- The third screen allows <strong>composing narratives</strong> by building  a series of snapshots, adding a title and short description for each step.The result is <strong>an interactive slideshow widget</strong> where the user's exploration of the network is guided step by step, revealing the key interpretation points one by one.</p><p>Manylines is a single webpage app built for HTML5 browsers.It makes an <strong>extensive use of the sigma.js library</strong> to deal with networks within the browser and it implements different features inspired from Gephi, the reference desktop graph viz platform.The WebGL visualization (with Canvas fallback) implemented by Sigma.js allows great performance for networks up to 1000 nodes on an average computer.To reach this level of performance, <strong>we optimized the javascript version of the ForceAtlas2 algorithm</strong> used by sigma.js.We ported it to use <strong>web workers</strong> and we optimized the <strong>Barnes-Hut quadtree approximation</strong> in this context by implementing it <strong>as an iterative and not recursive process</strong>.We made an extensive use of <strong>sigma.js' custom renderers and cameras</strong> to build dynamic graph thumbnails, snapshots and widgets.The server side stores the networks, snapshots and narrative data in a <strong>Couchbase database</strong>  (which we discovered in FOSDEM 2014) accessed by a <strong>Node.js express REST API</strong>.</p>

SUMMARY:Zero-Overhead Metaprogramming
DESCRIPTION: <p>Runtime metaprogramming enables many useful applications and is widely used in frameworks, middleware, and domain-specific languages to simplify the task of application developers. However, today’s language implementations rarely optimize even common concepts such as reflective method invocation or dynamic proxies, despite the fact that solutions for efficient implementations have been advocated since decades.</p><p>In this presentation, we demonstrate how self-optimizing interpreters can be used to implement runtime metaprogramming efficiently.For the implementation, we use SOM Smalltalk, a little Smalltalk implemented in RPython (think PyPy) as well as Truffle (with Graal on top of the JVM).We show that both platforms can remove the runtime overhead of reflection and thus open up new opportunities for metaprogramming in performance critical scenarios.</p>

SUMMARY:How (not) to create a language specification for Perl 6
DESCRIPTION: <p>In the process of designing, implementing, and using Perl 6 (or any programming language), people often refer to ""the language specification"" as a commonly understood and perhaps self-evident fixed reference point.  For mature languages this can be reasonable, because the people using that language have generally developed a shared understanding of what constitutes the language's specification.But languages are not all specified in the same manner, and in a new or rapidly evolving language it may be unwise to prematurely commit to an inflexible specification.  Perl 6 has gone through several imprecise notions of what constitutes its specification, such as design documents like the Synopses, reference implementations of certain features, and the ""official"" test suite.  This imprecision sometimes leads to misunderstandings among developers, confusion for newcomers to the language, and difficulty communicating with external audiences.This talk presents a historical perspective on how Perl 6's specification process has evolved over the past decade: identifying things we've done (or are doing) wrong, things we've gotten very right, and ideas of what that process ought to look like going forward.</p>

Containers running under rocket execute like regular processes and can be managed using existing process management tools like upstart, systemd, runit, and etc.</p><p>Rocket is also an implementation of the "App Container Spec" which defines how to define and build containerized applications based on tooling like tar and pgp. And then host these files easily using standard protocols like HTTP. The goal of the spec is to enable independent and creative implementations of container runtimes and build tools.</p><p>Both of these projects are open source and part of a young growing community. Come learn how they work and how you can get involved.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>Design is not simply skin deep, it interacts with deeper layers in software programs. And it is not just for people who point and click to use applications. It also affects people who cannot distinguish certain colours, who cannot use a mouse, who are confused by complex user interfaces, etc.What can designers and developers in open source projects do to make their software more accessible? What do they need to know about people with disabilities? What tools are available to help them? What are example projects that have worked to improve accessibility?</p>

SUMMARY:Enlightenment, a cross-platform window manager and toolkit
DESCRIPTION: <p>The EFL is a toolkit for writing cross-platform applications. Enlightenmentis a desktop shell built using this toolkit. Both the EFL and Enlightenmentare fast and light on resources (which made them the toolkit of choice inplaces such as the Tizen operating system and embedded environments) whileremaining scalable, but their low level approach complicates portability.In this talk I'd like to summarize our past portability issues and tacklecurrent ones, as well as talk about our future direction. The talk will befocused on FreeBSD, using it as an example, but will also cover our generalissues and portability to other operating systems including Windows and OS X.</p>

SUMMARY:Distributed tile processing with GeoTrellis and Spark
DESCRIPTION: <p>GeoTrellis is a geospatial Scala library and framework for doing high performance geospatial processing in a distributed environment. This past year the developers of GeoTrellis have created extensions to the Apache Spark cluster computing platform to ingest and process raster data stored in Accumulo and HDFS. Spark and GeoTrellis can be used to process and serve raster data through web services to create TMS tile layers that can be used on web maps. The framework can work with both spatial-only tiles, as well as spatial-temporal tiles such as climate model data.</p>

SUMMARY:CI as an infrastructure: components, patterns and problems
DESCRIPTION: <p>Usually we talk about CI as a process. We can start from very simple "checkout, build, test and deploy" idea and we might come to some complex scheme of interconnected tasks or jobs with different pipelines fulfilling certain requirements, but we mostly remain within the process scope dealing with problems like what to automate, how to automate and in which order to run those automated tasks.</p><p>However in this talk we are going to step back a bit and look at CI as an infrastructure, i.e. the system of services, which is constantly evolving to catch up with changes happening in the base project. We will go through number of examples trying to figure out basic principles and common patterns of CI infrastructure, and discuss the ways to solve common problems arising from them.</p>

SUMMARY:Arithmetic based implementation of a quadrature FM Demodulator
DESCRIPTION: <p>One of the key component in many GnuRadio projects is the quadrature frequency demodulator.This functionality allows to calculate the real analog output of a frequency modulated signal fromthe IQ-signal, which is mainly captured using HF hardware (e.g. dvb-t dongle, USRP, etc.) by acarrier frequency (band pass domain) and transform it to the base band domain. The most knownimplementations of the FM-demodulator are based on trigonometric functions. These functionsrequire a high computation effort. Some implementation of “tuned” trigonometric function, whichwere downsized for FM-demodulation reduce the computation effort a little.A new proposal of a so called arithmetic FM-Demodulator allows to avoid completely the usage ofany trigonometric function and speed up the computation process in many times.In the presentation I will introduce mathematical background for the arithmetic FM-Demodulator,show the differences and limitations to the current implementation in GnuRadio Version.Further Philipp will present our result, we had achieved in our lab.</p>

SUMMARY:Genode - OS security by design
DESCRIPTION: <p>Most provisions against the steadily growing threats imposed by malware, viruses, and directed attacks are fighting symptoms rather than addressing the root of the problem, which lies in the operating system. Genode is an open-source OS technology that promises to give an answer to those threats. By organizing the system as nested sandboxes and consequently applying the principle of least privilege, it protects the privacy of the user and renders most classes of malware ineffective. The talk will be presented on a Genode-based system, which allows the demonstration of the concepts live during the talk.</p>

SUMMARY:Teaching Fish to Fly
DESCRIPTION: <p>In 2013, at the Embedded Linux Conference in Europe in Edinburgh, there was a race between a dog and a blimp. It was said that despite the dogs win, that the blimp had participated in the miracle of flight. In 2014 we intend to show that the brains of that dog can be transplanted and that it too, can participate in the miracle of flight. The talk is mainly targeting taking an off the shelf embedded platform, MinnowBoard Max, and it's use in UAVs, specifically quad-copters. With the ability to do real time computer vision, as well as various GPIO capabilities we'll explore the directions that significantly more autonomous UAVs can take with Linux and embedded platforms using, mostly, off the shelf components.</p>

The first drivers are being converted and the final versions of the user-space IOCTL are being drafted. With it come all sorts of new, exciting features. But there are also confusing aspects to it.</p><p>This talk will give a brief history of how kernel mode-setting (KMS) evolved, explain some of the shortcomings of the current KMS API and how atomic mode-setting will make everything better.</p><p>The focus of the talk will be on how to convert existing kernel drivers to support atomic mode-setting based on lessons learned from going through the conversion of the Tegra DRM driver.</p>

SUMMARY:InvokeBinder
DESCRIPTION: <p>As one of the earliest adopters of Method Handles, I've had to build many of my own tools. InvokeBinder is one of them, providing a literal (or fluent) API for Method Handles that allows site-forward adaptation, name-based argument list manipulation, and many bonuses usually too complicated to write by hand. I'd like to demonstrate its features and enlist others to help me improve it.</p>

SUMMARY:Upstream Downstream
DESCRIPTION: <p>How is it to be a fairly large project upstream of several Linuxdistributions? How is it do be downstream of such a project? Among thechallenges are coordinating between distributions, handling differentexpectations from distributions and users, and technical issues suchas making the software easy to package. Using MySQL as the example,we'll go through several real-life cases and try to see them from bothsides of the developer-maintainer relationship.</p>

SUMMARY:moviCompile: An LLVM based compiler for heterogeneous SIMD code generation
DESCRIPTION: <p>Numerous applications in communication and multimedia domains show significant data-level parallelism (DLP). The amount ofDLP varies between applications in the same domain or even within a single application. Most architectures support a single vector-,SIMD-width which may not be optimal. This may cause performance and energy inefficiency. We propose the use of multiple(heterogeneous) vector-widths to better serve applications with varying DLP. The SHAVE (Streaming Hybrid Architecture VectorEngine) VLIW vector processor is an example of such an architecture. SHAVE is a unique VLIW processorthat provides hardware support for native 32-bit (short) and 128-bit (long) vector operations. Vector arithmetic unit (VAU) supports128-bit vector arithmetic of 8/16/32 − bit integer and 16/32 − bit floating point types. Scalar arithmetic unit (SAU) supports 32-bitvector arithmetic of 8/16 − bit integer and 16 − bit floating point types.</p><p>The moviCompile compiler is an LLVM based commercial compiler targeting code generation for SHAVE processor family.The moviCompile compiler is capable of SIMD code generation for 128-bit (long) and 64-bit vector operations. This work focuseson compiler backend support for 32-bit (short) vector operations. More specifically, this work aims to generate SIMD code forshort vector types (e.g. 4 x i8, 2 x i16, 2 x f16) that can be executed on 32-bit SAU next to the 128/64-bit SIMD code. As aresult, moviCompile is able to generate heterogeneous assembly code consisting of both short and long vector SIMD operations.</p>

SUMMARY:Wikimedia adopts Phabricator, deprecates seven infrastructure tools
DESCRIPTION: <p>Phabricator is an open source software development platform used for project management, bug reporting, and code review in an integrated fashion. Wikimedia has about 500 regular contributors developing MediaWiki plus hundreds of extensions and related tools. We are deploying https://phabricator.wikimedia.org to replace Bugzilla, RT, Trello, Mingle, Gerrit, gitblit, and Jenkins. This is the biggest and most complex Phabricator migration we are aware of, and we want to share our first-hand experiences with other free software projects.</p>

SUMMARY:Ruby-red onions: Peeling back Ruby's layers in C extensions
DESCRIPTION: <p>The fact that Ruby has different implementations is strange but also powerful as it allows us to write extensions. Although writing an extension can be a daunting task, there's no better way to get to the heart of what exactly Ruby objects are and the reason for some of the language's quirks.</p><p>In this talk, we'll use an example of writing a C extension for Ruby to use a third-party C security library. We'll peel back the layers of Ruby objects to deepen our knowledge of MRI and to understand in a little more detail what it really means to write object-oriented code.</p>

SUMMARY:Moving to the NoSQL side: MySQL JSON functions
DESCRIPTION: <p>Data is everywhere. User comments, preferences, online games features, all that small chunks of information which clients need to communicate with its servers use JSON format now. This format can be read into an object using parser built-in in all modern clients. But what about server side? What about information which should be stored for future use? Do you still need to manually parse JSON data to be able to effectively search through? Do you still need to spend time retrieving documents, load parse library and process? Not anymore! In this session I will present set of functions which manipulate with data in JSON format inside MySQL server. These functions search, modify and validate JSON data for you.</p>

SUMMARY:Surviving the Zombie Apocalypse
DESCRIPTION: <p>In our interconnected world of mobile and cloud computing, particularly with the rise of governmental spying, corporate espionage, and theft of data by organized crime syndicates, security is more important than ever.  Many claims are being made about the security of open-source cloud technologies: How can administrators, users, and developers separate fact from fiction?</p><p>This talk will equip the audience with the principles needed to evaluate security claims.  We will talk the nature of risk, of vulnerabilities and exploits; the various factors that reduce the risk of vulnerabilities in software;  and about TCB, threat models, and defense-in-depth.  And we will introduce a colorful and (hopefully) helpful analogy to help make these concepts more clear.</p><p>We will then apply these principles to three open-source cloud technologies: containers, KVM, and Xen, to see how they stack up.  These will be backed up with numbers: lines of code, security advisories, entry points, and so on.</p>

SUMMARY:Improving Key Signing Parties
DESCRIPTION: <p>KSP Tools is a set of tools to simplify and automate the tasks that are needed to attend a key signing party. They will significantly reduce the amount of work needed, and reduce the amount of errors that can be made. My aim is to reduce the amount of work to be done before and after the meeting to just 5 minutes, even with the large amount of people that attend the event at FOSDEM (~100 people), without compromising security.</p><p>I also hope to considerably shorten the amount of time that a key signing party takes through future work.</p><p>The current tools are:</p><ul><li>ksp-makelist: Generates a better formatted key list for usage at a key signing party. It's better looking, more readable, more comfortable to use and can be processed automatically by scanning QR codes.</li><li>ksp-scanlist: Makes a list of keys to sign by scanning QR codes from the above list.</li><li>ksp-list: Performs operations on a list of selected keys like signing keys and mailing them.</li><li>ksp-import-keys: Connects to a mail server and automatically imports signatures people emailed to you.</li></ul><p>The tools automatically check fingerprints and use a file format that is easy to handle with standard tools like grep and awk.</p><p>These tools were made after my experience with key signing parties at FOSDEM and I hope other people will find them useful.</p>

SUMMARY:Shenandoah - Project overview
DESCRIPTION: <p>Garbage Collection pauses make it hard for Java applications to meet quality of service guarantees.  No matter how fast your application processes requests, a 30 second GC pause is going to ruin any guarantees you might want to make.</p><p>Shenandoah is a new GC algorithm designed to address this issue. We take a simple approach that allows us to do more work while your Java program is running so we can substantially reduce the time the JVM is paused.  Our goal is to be able to garbage collect 100gb+ heaps in under 10ms.</p><p>This talk will focus on the current status of the project, the goals we've met so far, and what we are hoping to achieve in the coming year.  We might even share some performance numbers.</p>

SUMMARY:Viterbi's little Helper
DESCRIPTION: <p>Forward Error Correction (FEC) is a vital part of every communication scheme. Convolutional Error Codes can provide the protection of the data to drive the communication system close to the Shannon Limit. But due to the complexity of the decoders, it is challenging to implement these algorithms in software for use in software defined radios (SDR). Available coprocessors, such as graphic processor units (GPU) and single instruction multiple data architectures (SIMD) can dramatically enhance the throughput of such software based receivers. Strategies to start implementing Viterbi- and Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) Decoders on these coprocessors are presented in this talk. Potential tripping hazards are identified. The effects on the throughput of these algorithms are analyzed and shown.</p>

SUMMARY:Interfacing infrastructure as code with non-expert users
DESCRIPTION: <p>Implementing a tool to automate IT infrastructure management has many undeniable benefits. But that doesn't mean there aren't some drawbacks too (usually outweighed by the benefits) that we should be considering, and working to reduce or remove.</p><p>Implementing a tool like this in a team usually has a pretty significant impact: new processes, new language(s) to learn, new way of doing pretty much everything on your infrastructure. These tools are complex, so a minority of the team tends to become experts in it, and tries to lead the others. Resistance to change is common and understandable, but unfortunately, this can end up with some of the team members being left behind by the sudden and massive changes to their work. This is clearly not a Good Thing, and certainly not showing very good inclusiveness towards everyone. It is also making some configuration management projects fail, which is definitely a Bad Thing for those of us trying to implement them.</p><p>How to improve this situation is a topic dear to me. This has always been the focus of the Rudder and ncf open source projects I work on - making our technologies more accessible, easier to adopt and simpler to understand. Some key points we have focused on include:- Avoiding the <em>necessity</em> to write code (user interfaces of course, but that can be combined with other users writing code)- Separating roles so that experts can implement the <em>how</em> and others can focus on the <em>what</em>- Minimising the amount of effort required (sane and non-surprising default values, auto-configuration where possible, ...)</p><p>This talk will explain some of these concepts, and show how we have achieved considerable success using the ""ncf builder"" web interface that can be used to write configuration management policy without writing any code (see http://www.ncf.io).</p>

SUMMARY:Java restart with WebFX
DESCRIPTION: <p>The purpose of the WebFX project is to investigate the capabilities of using JavaFX to build rich web applications. Actually, it is an attempt to create a new web where HTML is replaced with FXML — the markup language for JavaFX UI, and the logic can be written in any programming language that is available on top of Java platform from JavaScript, Groovy, JRuby to Java, Kotlin and Scala. Java ReStart is a complimentary project that acts as transport layer for WebFX allowing FXML pages to reference arbitrary Java byte code on a web server and hence any custom JavaFX UI components and Java third-party libraries. In addition, Java ReStart allows to run arbitrary Java applicationsinstantly from a web server downloading only required parts of applications on demand and executing them in parallel with downloading.</p><p>I would like to give an overview of the projects, make a live demo, compare the proposed technologies with traditional web and native clients, show how the technologies differ from Java applets and Java Webstart, reveal benefits in compare with RDP-like approaches. Finally, I will share my vision on how to evolve the projects.</p>

SUMMARY:PDF signing in LibreOffice: no longer experimental
DESCRIPTION: <p>During the Google Summer of Code in 2012, Gökçen Eraslan implemented digital signatures for LibreOffice's PDF export. There were some glitches left in the feature, for instance it did not really work well on Windows, which is where most of our users are. Because of that, the functionality was marked as "experimental" and was thus not easily available to users. Recently, thanks to a crowdfunding effort, we had the opportunity to improve this feature. The presentation will describe that work and show how to use the feature.</p>

SUMMARY:It’s not a bug, it’s an environment problem. 
DESCRIPTION: <p>It’s not a bug, it’s an environment problem.Environments are costly and data refreshes tedious. As a result, QA analysts have to make compromises and work in environments that have a different makeup than the production environment, which can create false positives and missed bugs. This presentation will help QA engineers learn how to mitigate the lack of data refreshes by creating modular test cases and use parameters to dissociate the data from the test cases and automation and therefore be able to work with data that you do have in each environment. Additionally, it will dive into how to maximize the environments QA professionals currently have and align them to their testing process to do feature testing and regression efficiently.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>By replacing the Linux Kernel's TCP/IP stack with picoTCP, we aim to lower the threshold to use Linux on small embedded systems and bring it to the IoT world. In this case we ran it on a Cortex-M microcontroller with a few MBs of RAM and flash.Using picoTCP inside the kernel results in a reduction of the kernel's size by over 300 kb, while still having all of the TCP/IP functionality an embedded system might need, and more.The talk will start with a demo, then a motivition why we did this, and finally explaining how we did this.</p>

The open-source software stacks they use gain recognition, contributors, and momentum.</p><p>Go has many advantages in this kind of environment, and seems well-posed for becoming its <em>de facto</em> language. But we're definitely not there yet.</p><p>This talk is an experience report of Go in the "modern enterprise" of SoundCloud, and my opinion of what needs to happen with the language and ecosystem for it to gain real mindshare in that environment.</p>

SUMMARY:Computers, Clocks and Network Time
DESCRIPTION: <p>Most people who work with computers have no idea how the computers keep time.  All networked computer  systems require some form of temporal synchronization.  As networks have gotten faster the demands for accurate, distributed, timekeeping have increased, but most programmers have no idea about the quality of the clocks in their systems, nor how they might be kept in sync.  This talk will go over the basics of computer clocks, why they're inaccurate, and what can be expected from various strategies for getting systems into sync.</p>

SUMMARY:High-performance packet filtering with Pflua
DESCRIPTION: <p>Pflua is a fresh implementation of the well-known pcap-filter language (pflang), designed to filter network traffic in the Snabb Switch.  It is, to our knowledge, the fastest pflang implementation. This talk introduces pflua, its two compilation pipelines, its performance, and shows a demonstration of pflua filtering traffic at 10Gb line-speed in a Snabb Switch.</p>

SUMMARY:Multi-threaded replication in MySQL 5.6 and 5.7
DESCRIPTION: <p>Replication is used everywhere with MySQL. But applying writes in a single thread is often a bottleneck: replicas have a hard time keeping up with the master that can execute writes in parallel. Enter MySQL 5.6 and you can use several threads to apply writes on replicas as long as you have several schemas. MySQL 5.7 goes even further: by introducing a logical clock and by changing the scheduling logic, you can apply writes in parallel in a single schema.</p><p>Come to this session to learn all you need to be comfortable with multi-threaded replication.</p>

SUMMARY:All your cycles are belong to us
DESCRIPTION: <p>We live in an age in which every person owns two or three devices that are powerful enough to render a few seconds of 3D movies in a while although they are used mainly to send messages via WhatsApp and create selfies for social network consumption. At the same time, all these devices have the closest thing to an universal virtual machine that has ever existed: the JavaScript virtual machined, paired to a (roughly) standard object model that allows anybody with a bit of programming prowess to create programs that can be run anywhere and everywhere.There is great potential for massive distributed computing in this environment, but the ability to tap it a bit farther than sending basic computations is not there yet. In this presentation we will talk about the issues involved in doing so, from basic algorithmic issues to twisted legal issues that can arise when you are using devices you don't own to perform unwitting computations.</p>

SUMMARY:Caciocavallo, or how we ported OpenJDK from embedded to cloud and still liked it
DESCRIPTION: <p>Caciocavallo has been one of the very first external projects to land in the OpenJDK repository and sponsored by the OpenJDK Porters Group. Named after a delicious cheese we're never tired of eating, it had the original purpose of refactoring the AWT peers to allow different implementations to be added to OpenJDK. The project evolved very quickly until it became itself a full implementation of AWT based on Swing with just enough abstraction to allow custom plugging into the Java2D system for rendering. As time passed, this characteristic was used to implement a GUI testing framework running on offscreen buffers to avoid the usual problems of focus stealing and random mouse moving that plague every other GUI testing framework (here everything is emulated!), and finally a full Web based backend to allow application to run remotely but still be visible on the local screen. This talk will cover the progress we have done over the years, we will show how easy is to implement a new backend and how this project could be used to give Wayland support to OpenJDK. We will show the testing framework and finally we will discuss about WebJDK, an idea to give more web oriented functionality to OpenJDK and use the web backend to enable fully cloud based applications.</p>

SUMMARY:Synthesizing gateware with GCC
DESCRIPTION: <p>Programmable devices such as FPGAs can potentially offer very significant computational power, but implementing efficient solutions on them can be a hard task. Oneof the main obstacles is the usage of hardware description language (HDL), whose knowledge is usually a rare expertise.To overcome or at least to mitigate this issue, High Level Synthesis (HLS) has been introduced: a (semi)-automatic design flow, potentially composed of several methodologies, thatstarting from a high level representation of the specification to be implemented (e.g., from its C/C++ source code implementation) produces its hardware implementation.This talk presents Bambu a free HLS tools based on GCC developed at Politecnico di Milano, that generated synthesizable HDL description starting from ANSI specifications.</p>

SUMMARY:Ultra - Smallest. Web server. Evar.
DESCRIPTION: <p>This talk introduces a brand new web server - Ultra. With a binary at just 51K it's small, fast, and encompasses an all-in-memory web server with an in-built NoSQL datastore, a data processing language, SSI, multiple configurations, and logging. If you want to learn basic networking programming, its source is small enough for you to learn from. The talk covers the basic architecture and approach in keeping a small footprint, and breaks down the source into easily understandable blocks.</p>

SUMMARY:QtQuick in Complex Applications
DESCRIPTION: <p>It is well known that QtQuick is cool, trendy, and empowers you to make your applications looking awesome. Various tutorials and talks discuss that and how to do this, but seldom reach the point where they talk about QtQuick usage for more complex use cases than a simple game/a small example text editor. In this talk, I will discuss how the mechanisms in "hybrid" C++ (logic, models, data) and QtQuick (the fancy looking stuff) applications work and what are best practices there. This includes a very brief recap of QtQuick and QML, but mainly focuses on how to access and communicate data from the QtQuick engine that is provided by the C++ models, and the other way around. The talk will conclude with a walk through different pitfalls and best practices when working with QtQuick UIs of significant size.</p>

SUMMARY:Datacenter Provisioning and Orchestration
DESCRIPTION: <p>Discovery and tracking of data center resources to enable highly accurate server provisioning and software deployments is a complex problem. The inability to make available resources for use in production in a timely and cost effective manner causes overruns across product and feature life-cycles. Automating discovery, provisioning and orchestration cuts down on delays. This talk presents Genesis, an open source ruby DSL developed at Tumblr. Genesis provides a DSL for resource discovery and is part of an open source stack from Tumblr, alongside Phil (Provisioning) and Collins (Orchestration).</p>

SUMMARY:The New MySQL Replication Features in MySQL 5.7 and Beyond 
DESCRIPTION: <p>MySQL replication is the foundation for both scalability and highavailability for many of the world’s busiest services, in particular,those that operate at scale on the Web. In fact, some of the largestand highest profile online applications trust their data to MySQL andregard MySQL Replication as the key technology to ensure that data isalways available, even in the event of catastrophic disasters.</p><p>MySQL Replication strives to keep on meeting the ever tougherrequirements of online services so that it can be deployed togetherwith them in symbiotic harmony. In fact, in recent years we haveseen an exponential development in MySQL, in particular inreplication.</p><p>MySQL 5.6 was a major step forward, with fabulous replicationfeatures, but the work continues and MySQL 5.7 is set to be anotherground breaking release.  The next generation of replication featuresare scattered over several technical areas, including: bettersemi-synchronous replication; enhanced multi-threaded slaveperformance; improved monitoring; online configuration changes;options for fine tuning the replication stream performance; supportfor more advanced topologies; developer friendly frameworks and muchmore. This is just the tip of the iceberg. In fact, in the lab wehave more exciting news such as the MySQL Group Replication plugin,a plugin that brings group communication techniques and databasereplication together.</p><p>Seize the opportunity to learn about the new MySQL Replicationfeatures' internals, the technical details and the roadmap. Come andlearn what is already there in MySQL 5.7 and what's still in themaking.</p>

SUMMARY:What Three Big Development Trends Mean for Java
DESCRIPTION: <p>As with the past few years, we'll start by examining via various statistical benchmarks where Java is today and how it is performing relative to its competition. We'll mine various communities use and discussion of Java to try and determine where Java ranks today versus its historical performance.</p><p>With that foundation set, we'll examine three important developer trends and the opportunities - or threats - they present to Java. From the convenience of cloud to the challenges of application lifecycles to the fatigue of fragmentation, we'll walk through the basics of the choices and challenges developers are facing today with an eye towards their implications for Java.</p>

SUMMARY:Packed Objects, Object Layout & Value Types - a Survey
DESCRIPTION: <p>Java is often criticized for its lack of supporting C-style structs. This makes it hard to efficiently implement certain type of data structures (like for example arrays of small objects) in Java.</p><p>However, recently there have been several different approaches which try to address this problem. My talk will briefly introduce "Packed Objects", an extension available in IBM's Java SDK 8, "Object Layout", a layout-optimized Java data structure package proposed by Azul Systems and Value Types [3][4], an OpenJDK proposal for immutable, reference-free value objects.</p><p>I will describe the commonalities and differences of the three approaches and explain how they can improve the memory overhead and locality of Java objects.</p>

SUMMARY:Mobile Map Technology
DESCRIPTION: <p>The main capability of this library is the Multiplatform approach, it have the very same API in all environments thanks to coding translation.Developing with Glob3 Mobile you can save time and resources when you face a mobile development having all advantages of native development (Performance, UI, Access to disk, sensors, etc) and the simplicity of an API thought for GIS developers.During 2013-2014 G3M has been growing in capabilities and is now a solution to face the development of any map application on any device. In this presentation We will explain the architecture and the main capabilities of this library and we will show some examples and demos and use cases with the API working.Glob3 Mobile has been developed thinking in the usability and the UI of mobile devices. Currently Glob3 Mobile is working in the next platforms: * iOS * Android * Google Glass * html5-webgl and it is planned to add others like Windows 8 or Java Desktop.</p>

SUMMARY:To The Moon And Back. Software Defined Radio and High Power transmissions.
DESCRIPTION: <p>Today, GNURadio enthusiasts are in the same situation as radio electronics enthusiasts about 90 years ago: Many ideas sound very promising, but international regulations and national laws prohibit extended experimenting. Radio Amateurs such as Nobel Price winner Joe Taylor (K1JT) have demonstrated that digital signal processing allows moonbounce transmissions also to the private hacker, but also many more thrilling experiments such as airplane scatter and the active use of Amateur Radio satellites. Most, however, require a little more power than those 10 dBm produced by the USRP series. This talk shows how easy it is to make use of the definitions of international Amateur Radio regulations as part of the ITU ruleset and how to get a license according to national laws - and to experiment with GNURadio -and- with high power.</p>

SUMMARY:Cirela, open source solutions to manage, monitor and prevent natural and environment disasters; an initial work
DESCRIPTION: <p>CIRELA (Communication and Information technology for REsiLience to disAsters) is a non profit NGO aiming at providing open source solutions to manage, monitor and prevent natural and environmental disasters. Currently we are focusing on wireless sensor network (WSN) based monitoring and warning systems.</p><p>We are working on WSN applications where people in a disaster-prone area can actively participate, to have access to information, to be warned on time, and to have their own sensor if they want. Jakarta with frequent flood events is currently a case we are working on.</p><p>A 'simple' WSN based flood monitoring application will measure water levels on different locations using sensors, put this information on a server and make it available to users, warn people when the water level in an area is higher than an acceptable limit, ... So we have to manage a geographically distributed and concurrent system where sensor modules represent concurrent processes.</p><p>We want to have a pleasant and user friendly environment for end-users as well as for programmers. We started to develop our applications with Pharo. We'll show Pharo with OpenStreetMap and Roassal2:- to visualize geographic data and information- to present and to simulate wireless sensor networks</p>

SUMMARY:Over 9000: The Future of JRuby
DESCRIPTION: <p>JRuby 9000 represents the biggest-ever leap forward for JRuby. Not only have we caught up on compatibility (9000 will be 2.2-compatible from release), but we've completely redesigned our JVM-based runtime and have opened our codebase up to the JRuby+Truffle research project from Oracle Labs. The changes we've made will make it easier to keep up with MRI on compatibility and give us the potential to run Ruby as fast as Java or C. The entire Ruby world will change over the next year, and JRuby 9000 will be leading the way. We'll talk about what Ruby's going to look like once JRuby is "over 9000".</p>

SUMMARY:Perl 6
DESCRIPTION: <p>With the complete failure of security forces to contain the impending threat of Perl 6, developers are beginning to investigate it themselves. Unfortunately, many of the combatants who wield Camelia are so enraptured that they post long sermons extolling the virtues of hyperoperators, meta-object protocols, and composable concurrency, scaring off the faithful.Those sermons are important. However, it turns out Perl 6 is actually a fairly easy weapon to use and for day-to-day use, it's simple. This talk will take things down a notch or three and show you how simple basic Perl 6 really is. The talk might even be less objectionable than this description.</p>

SUMMARY:Reached milestones and ongoing development on Replicant
DESCRIPTION: <p>Replicant was started as a pragmatic way to achieve software freedom on mobile devices, as a fully free version of Android. Over the years, support was added for a dozen of different mainstream devices. However, most of these are severely flawed when it comes to software freedom and privacy/security. Thus, it was decided to focus the development effort on a few specific devices that perform better than others from those perspectives, instead of trying to catch up with the latest mainstream devices.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>Around FOSDEM 2015, the first alpha/beta releases of Apache Lucene 5 will likely be downloadable. This talk will present the improvements and new features, but also some incompatible changes in the Lucene 5 release. Lucene 5 will focus on data safety: The move to Java 7 will be completed. Lucene now uses all the brand new features (NIO.2) of Java 7 to make the indexing process more stable and resulting indexes durable. Checksums are used during merging to prevent bugs in the underlying JVM or data corruption due to networking errors (e.g., while distributing indexes during recovery in Elasticsearch) to persist in newly created index segments.</p>

SUMMARY:Contract-based Programming - A Route to Finding Bugs Earlier
DESCRIPTION: <p>Contract-based programming is a software development technique, whichis used to find programming errors earlier in the development process."Contract" refers to formal declarations of how types and subprograms("functions and methods" if you aren't an Ada programmer already)behave.  In the strictest form, the contracts are checked as a partof the compilation process, and only a program which can be provento conform with the contracts will compile.In a less strict form, it is more similar to "preventive debugging",where the contracts are inserted as run-time checks, which makes itmore likely to identify errors during testing.</p><p>Ada provides a quite extensive support for contract-based programming.The checks are specified as a mix of compile-time checks, obligatoryrun-time checks, and optional run-time checks.  In addition to that,SPARK defines a subset of Ada with full compile-time checks.</p>

SUMMARY:Jitsi Videobridge in Cryptoland: the adventures of a Java WebRTC video router on the road to supporting 1000s of video streams
DESCRIPTION: <p>In Jitsi Videobridge (https://jitsi.org/Projects/JitsiVideobridge), a WebRTC video conferencing router, encryption and packet signing were among the most expensive components in terms of CPU intensity. We therefore set out on a journey to optimize them as much as possible.</p><p>We would like to share this journey with the Java FLOSS community.</p><p>We are going to present a comparison we have made on the execution times of popular open source implementations of AES and SHA-1 in search of the best performer. Our reference implementations are provided by the pure-Java Bouncy Castle cryptography APIs. Our contenders are an assortment of widely-used Java and cross-platform C code: the SunJCE security provider optimized by Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 8, the Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) libraries employed through the SunPKCS11 security provider and the OpenSSL Crypto library accessed with the help of the Java Native Interface (JNI).</p><p>We're going to pit software against hardware in our examination how we can leverage the Advanced Encryption Standard New Instructions (AES-NI).</p><p>We're going to look at the performance compromises of transferring bytes between Java and C. Can we beat Java's intrinsics? Will Java New/Non-blocking I/O (NIO) be better?</p>

SUMMARY:Supporting Nouveau on the Tegra K1 System-on-chip
DESCRIPTION: <p>Although Tegra K1 uses the same Kepler architecture as NVIDIA desktop cards that Nouveau already supports, there are other challenges that need to be addressed before Nouveau can drive K1's graphic acceleration: the fact that the GPU does not reside on the PCI bus requires architectural changes in the Nouveau core. The absence of dedicated GPU memory directly interferes with the way Nouveau is used to do memory management and leads to potentially sub-optimal behavior. Also, in a system where all devices share the same system memory, PRIME support is mandatory to perform any useful work and the relevance of a driver-agnostic memory allocator becomes perceptible.</p><p>This talk will discuss these challenges, and in particular the consequences of using a unified memory architecture, in the hope of triggering discussions that will help improving the general support of GPU architectures for new mobile platforms.</p>

SUMMARY:Use DPDK and the Linux Kernel
DESCRIPTION: <p>The SDN Community is building network automation along with OpenStack Neutron's capabilities. This creates connectivity based on Linux kernel functions, prevents single vendor solution lock-in and avoids building proprietary data paths. With DPDK and packet processing software to create NFVI, it is possible to keep this openness while both introducing performance and avoiding Neutron plugins for proprietary technologies. In this presentation, Vincent will show how DPDK applications can be combined on the host and guest of the network, and compute nodes of OpenStack scenarios, in order to sustain high performance for north-south and east-west traffic that is required for NFV solutions. 100 Gbps of packet processing throughput examples will be demonstrated.</p><p>Down the road, this openness shall apply on any packet processing data plane logic: on x86 hypervisors, ARM CPUs, new IBM Power8 or PCI SmartNICs (Cavium, Broadcom, Tilera).</p><p>Vincent will show that in networking, "Open" and "SPEED MATTERS" mean:- keep Linux kernel stack- freedom of Hardware IOs</p>

SUMMARY:Superturbocharging Firefox OS app development with node-firefox
DESCRIPTION: <p>Did you know that every Gecko runtime can be debugged and controlled remotely using the Firefox DevTools remote protocol?</p><p>In this talk we'll look into the architecture of debuggable runtimes, how to speak protocol.js and how we're using it to build a series of node modules that together act like a WebIDE command line counterpart, but might also be incorporated into existing typical web development workflows using tools such as Gulp or Grunt. We'll also talk about the challenges that we've faced when taking this from a hack into a solid product, and some of the most promising features that this work makes possible: faster app development and filling the gaps on the Firefox OS Cordova/PhoneGap plugins.</p>

SUMMARY:Are distributions really boring and a solved problem?
DESCRIPTION: <p>Recently distributions are often perceived as boring, and working mostly onsolved problems, as the focus is moving away to hype stuff such asconfiguration management or the Cloud. However, distributions are in the bestspot to address a number of important challenges -- both old ones that neverhad a satisfying solution so far, and arising ones. I will describe ongoingwork on some of those challenges (mainly in Debian), as well as some thoughtson how we could address other challenges.</p>

SUMMARY:Technical Aspects of Leap Second Propagation and Evaluation
DESCRIPTION: <p>Leap seconds are scheduled by the International Earth Rotation Service (IERS) whenever the difference between true earth rotation and the UTC time scale reaches a certain limit. Whenever a leap second has been scheduled by the IERS, a warning must be disseminated to time keeping devices so that clocks become aware of the scheduled leap second early enough to be able to handle the leap second properly.</p><p>There are different ways to propagate leap second warnings using different timing signals, protocols, etc. For example, the GPS satellites transmit a specific point in time when a leap second is to be inserted or deleted, but other timing signals may just provide a leap second warning flag which is set during a certain interval before the leap event, where the warning interval depends on the specification of the protocol.</p><p>Also, there are different implementations how leap seconds are handled, which especially affect the sequence of timestamps across the leap second event. The clock can be stepped at the beginning or end of the leap second, can be slowed down or even stopped during a leap second insertion, or time can be slewed across a leap second. This makes it difficult to compare time stamps which have been taken on different systems during a leap second.</p><p>Last, but not least, there are implementations of time keeping code which don't always work correctly, e.g. invalid leap second warnings are generated, leap seconds are not handled at all, or severe bugs occur due to side effects of the leap second handling.</p>

SUMMARY:The challenges of open mobile design
DESCRIPTION: <p>Designing in the open has inherent difficulties as the danger of producing a camel always lurks. At the same time the status quo in mobile UI is consumption-oriented. These are the big challenges we face when working on Glacier UI for nemomobile and I believe they are worth talking about.</p><p>This talk starts with a brief introduction on ways to handle the risk of losing the vision and coherence of the design while still fostering participation, and how we are trying to do that on the nemomobile project. Being friendly and accepting proposals and at the same time keeping a grip on the focus of the design, in a project that lives exclusively on contributors' free time: compromises, solutions and ideals. A quick overview of the tools and workflow follows, and the rest of the presentation delves into the specifics of mobile OS interface design and how we try to evolve a mobile UI that enables productivity on a small screen as opposed to mere content consumption, with Glacier UI.</p><p>For more information on nemomobile and Glacier UI visit http://play.qwazix.com/grog/</p>

Reforms to the JCP through JCP.Next as well as through the Adopt-a-JSR programs have enabled this involvement from the community that is vital to the success of Java. The free and open source community now have greater opportunities for contributions and feedback . We will discuss the current state of the nation on these programs and ask for feedback and suggestions for greater participation moving forward through the ongoing JCP.Next effort, specifically JSR 364, Broadening JCP Membership and JSR 358, A major revision to the Java Community Process.</p>

SUMMARY:OpenLayers 3: A unique web-mapping library
DESCRIPTION: <p>OpenLayers 3 is the new version of the OpenLayers web-mapping library. We've rewritten the library from the ground up with the goal of offering a powerful, high-performance library leveraging the latest in web technologies such as Canvas and WebGL. This talk will present the latest advances of the library, focusing on aspects that make OpenLayers 3 stand out. OpenLayers 3, for example, uses techniques and algorithms that enable high-quality and high-performance vector rendering. Come learn about the optimizations and techniques OpenLayers 3 uses internally, and what makes OpenLayers 3 unique among its competitors.</p>

SUMMARY:Project Calico: A pure Layer 3 approach to virtual networking.
DESCRIPTION: <p>An important part of building a virtual datacenter is networking. The common wisdom in the field is that providing virtual layer 2 networks built using one of the many open source vSwitches is the correct approach. This talk covers Project Calico, an open source attempt to provide an alternative approach by re-architecting the data center in the image of the Internet, aiming for simplicity, scale and efficiency.</p>

SUMMARY:The ARM microJIT, a JIT for the IoT
DESCRIPTION: <p>We have all got used to memory being essentially infinite, however the IoT reopens the constrained device with devices having 256M or less. This project looks at developing an ARM microJIT targeted at these devices. The project is based on the original work I did on the Thumb2 JIT (FOSDEM 2010).</p><p>The project targets the Raspberry PI which is an ideal IoT development/demonstration platform. Unfortunately the Thumb2 JIT does not support the Raspberry PI because the Raspberry PI does not have the Thumb2 instruction set. This is a project which I am working on in my 'free' time and I hope to have a demonstrable port by FOSDEM.</p><p>Finally I would like to have a discussion about the future of this work.</p>

SUMMARY:Mozilla ID - Developing and protecting a living brand
DESCRIPTION: <p>I propose to introduce the audience to Mozilla's new brand project Mozilla ID. Mozilla ID is a very new project, launched in August 2014 and headed by Mozilla's art director Sean Martell. Mozilla ID aims at developing the core pillars for a new, living Mozilla brand, consisting of a word mark and logo. Mozilla's aim with the project is to allow unlimited variants of the Mozilla logo which will be based on live community data. There will be a logo generator that Mozilla is currently working on where contributors can select the data feeds and colors and it will output SVG versions of the logo for use. People will be able to customize the look based on the options they choose. Effectively, the openness and community contribution that is at the core of Mozilla's software projects will be transferred also to its branding, enhancing community identification on that additional level.</p><p>I will first of all introduce the project and will show images to illustrate the ongoing creative development process led by Sean Martell.</p><p>Moving on to the protection angle: I will speak about traditional patterns of trademark protection and enforcement and how these are being challenged by the market and marketing realities of our modern times. I will speak about the advantages and appeal of living, or fluid, brands, giving examples (such as Google doodle, MTV, Absolut Vodka, to name but a few).  I will point out risks and provide guidance on how a living brand can bridge the divide between valuable community contribution and identification and the restrictions of trademark protection. Essentially, a living brand can have a steady distinctive core which suffices to maintain trademark protection, while certain of its characteristics may be subject to change, community contribution and innovation. The key challenge is to define the core that is to be the subject of trademark protection, without unduly restricting the process of innovation that makes the brand a living brand.</p>

SUMMARY:The Future of JavaScript
DESCRIPTION: <p>EcmaScript 6 aka Harmony, the next version of the JavaScript language, is now feature frozen and the publication is expected around March 2015. Now is a good time to take a closer look at the new version. It brings new powerful features to the language, making it easier and nicer than ever to program with JavaScript. This includes (but isn't limited to) generators, destructuring patterns, function improvements, classes. The best thing is that you don't have to wait to try them. A lot of these new shiny language improvements are already present in Firefox. If we look a bit further down the path, preparation has already started for EcmaScript 7. The next big thing could be SIMD, Typed Objects ...</p>

SUMMARY:What Could Microkernels Learn from Monolithic Kernels (and Vice Versa)
DESCRIPTION: <p>Some developers of both microkernel and monolithic operating systems view the design of their system as absolutely superior to the other design. This black-white thinking and "holy war" attitude, while understandable to a certain degree, makes it hard to to acknowledge that one size does not necessarily fit all. Rather than striving for an unreachable goal of creating the best operating system design for all possible use cases it is vital to understand and reflect the trade-offs of the use cases at hand. This talk focuses on a few features and properties of the current monolithic operating systems that could be an inspiration for the current microkernel operating systems and vice versa. The talk should also initiate a discussion about some "non-goals" of microkernel operating systems that are nevertheless sometimes presented as goals of microkernel operating systems, to the detriment of its own cause.</p>

SUMMARY:MCUIO/LININOIO - Virtualizing MCU peripherals
DESCRIPTION: <p>MCUIO/LININOIO - Virtualizing MCU peripherals</p><p>The MCUIO/LININOIO subsystem allows a Microprocessor Unit (MPU), somehowconnected to a Microcontroller Unit (MCU), to see the MCU's peripherals asstandard Linux peripherals (i.e. gpios, i2c adapters, pwms, ...).The basic communication protocol is completely generic, it just defines waysto read/write a (virtualized) memory space on the MCU. Standard, vendorindependent memory maps are then defined for each kind of MCU peripheral, sothat MCU specific implementation details can be ignored by the MPU.Interrupt events can be spontaneously sent by the MCU to the MPU as writerequests.The protocol is transport independent, only a bidirectional channel is required(for instance rs232 or even a network connection).</p>

SUMMARY:CockroachDB
DESCRIPTION: <h2>CockroachDB a distributed database written in Go.</h2><p>Many NoSQL databases come with a focus on performance, availability and scalability, sacrificing strong consistency guarantees along the way. In effect, this shifts the burden of providing consistency to the application, and often results in complex and error-prone application logic.Just a few years ago, an intense effort by Google resulted in Spanner - a globally distributed, replicated datastore that puts transactions back where they belong: right into the heart of the database.</p><p>CockroachDB is a grass-roots effort to bring to the table the guarantees of Spanner (and more) in an open source scalable database that is easy to deploy and, despite the name, quite attractive to have around.</p>

We'll cover the whole system from the parser to emitting the actual machine code bytes - and we won't have to leave our Java IDE to do it.</p><p>We won't shy away from technical depth where it's needed to uncover all the details, but Truffle is designed to be a high-level and simple system accessible to non-experts. Novices will get an insight into the big ideas, and experts will be able to find out how it all really works.</p>

Finally, we'll see the roadmap of this fully open source project (aGPLv3)</p>

SUMMARY:The Wisdom Of Crowd Testing OpenJDK
DESCRIPTION: <p>In the beginning, there were bugs. In order to find them faster, before  a JDK release, the OpenJDK Adoption Group began a quality outreach effort. Initially focused on JDK 8, the effort expanded to cover JDK 7  Updates, JDK 8 Updates and JDK 9 OpenJDK Projects. It now lists dozens of open source projects and communities that participate in testing early access builds of the JDK, report issues they find, and help get them resolved in time.</p><p>In this session, you'll learn what worked, and what didn't, and what you can do to join the OpenJDK crowd testing fun with your own open source project to help us find showstopper bugs before they can bite.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>SQL has gone out of fashion lately—partly due to the NoSQL movement, but mostly because SQL is often still used like 20 years ago. As a matter of fact, the SQL standard continued to evolve during the past decades resulting in the current release of 2011. In this session, we will go through the most important additions since the widely known SQL-92, explain how they work and how PostgreSQL supports and extends them. We will cover common table expressions and window functions in detail and have a very short look at the temporal features of SQL:2011 and the related features of PostgreSQL.</p>

SUMMARY:IgProf
DESCRIPTION: <p>IgProf is a GPL, general purpose, cross platform (x86_64, x86, ARMv7-A, ARM64/AArch64), memory and performance profiling tool originally developed 10 years ago in the context of LHC experiments at CERN (*), to enable optimisation of simulation and data acquisition software. It provides detailed, call-stack level, information on where time / energy is spent and memory allocations happen using a variety of techniques varying from dynamic instrumentation to sampled profiling. While not dissimilar from other similar softwares like Google perftools it was specially tailored to profile extremely large C++ applications comprising millions lines of codes, loading thousands of dynamic libraries and with a very high memory allocation frequency. In addition, ease-of-use and the ability to easily share performance profiles between distributed collaborators are important aspects to enable use by a large community of scientists with varying software development skills.</p>

The last step into getting full Xen support into FreeBSD was to get it to run as a PVH Dom0, which is now finished and in a tech-preview status.</p><p>This talk will include a high-level description of the modifications needed in order to get FreeBSD running as a Dom0, and a demo of FreeBSD running as a PVH Xen Dom0.</p>

SUMMARY:Overpass API
DESCRIPTION: <p>Using OpenStreetMap data almost always requires filtering for thematic extracts. Overpass API is a web service for this purpose, available at overpass-api.de. Its source code is licensed under AGPL.</p><p>The open data project OpenStreetMap aims at creating a geographic database of the entire world, i.e. collecting the data necessary to make any map of what is on the ground. Starting in 2004, it has now grown to more than a million registered mappers. In most places details are mapped including each footpath. In some places even streetlamps, trees, wastebaskets, and similar things are mapped.</p><p>Overpass API allows you to extract data by geographic search criteria, by subject, by structual properties or an arbitrary combination of them. In this way you can realize an always up-to-date data overlay on a slippy map, a desktop data browser, conveniently pull data from OpenStreetMap into QGIS, do quality assurance or a lot of other things.</p><p>In this talk I will present Overpass API by the above mentioned example use cases. Furthermore, I will give a short overview over the components and the query language. This gives you a starting point to integrate OpenStreetMap data into your application of choice.</p>

SUMMARY:Puppet Plus Parentheses
DESCRIPTION: <p>Puppet is a tool for configuration management and automation.  It’s written in Ruby, and therefore its codebase contains a notable lack of parentheses.  So, we set out to solve that problem and wrote Puppet Server: a new, open source implementation of the Puppet Master, written in Clojure.  In this talk, we’ll discuss the development of Puppet Server, our experience with Clojure, and some of the dragons slain along the way.  I’ll also give an introduction to Trapperkeeper - an open source application framework for Clojure programs, which we developed along the way.</p>

SUMMARY:Requirements Bazaar
DESCRIPTION: <p>In this Lightning Talk we want to present “Requirements Bazaar 2.0” that aims to be a social platform to bring developers and end-users together. In years of research we have developed and actually operated an Open Innovation Platform for gathering requirements for prototypes in large international academic projects. The last version of the current product is available under http://requirements-bazaar.org . End-users can enter their requirements by providing short descriptions including user stories, screenshots and other images. The requirements can then be shared amongst its users. On the other side of the chain, developers may take up ideas and transfer the accepted requirements to an issue system like JIRA.</p><p>Over the last years it turned out that people want more lightweight and mobile-friendly tools; we found the old monolithic system to be very hard to maintain to add new features. Therefore we are currently redeveloping it from scratch integrating many ideas from our users and incorporating new research findings. We are further driven by a mobile-first approach to support a wide variety of devices. We additionally want to support various social features like sharing on social networks or blogs and allowing discussions and rating amongst end-users and developers.</p><p>At FOSDEM we would like to encourage open source developers in rethinking the way requirements are currently gathered from the crowd. How do we want to collect new software ideas or simply feature requests from our users. Will it really be through feedback forms in our apps’ “About” menu? Do our users really think in terms of issues like we developers do? How can gamification be used to reward actual end-users of software? We hope Requirements Bazaar can answer these questions and fill the gap!</p>

SUMMARY:Torturing your software with 124 ODF file formats
DESCRIPTION: <p>Good software can take a hit. Most software can't. The OpenDocument Format (ODF) specification is quite large and very important. Now that it is being adopted more and more, many strange and wonderful documents will be created by custom software that claim to be ODF documents. The ODF softwares of the world should be prepared. That's why ODFAutoTests helps you to create outlandish documents and lets you run them through your software.</p><p>This talk will include an enticing argument for writing tests and will present the audience with the data of running the current tests on the current software.</p>

SUMMARY:VXVDE: almost zero configuration virtual networking
DESCRIPTION: <p>VXVDE does not require any program to dispatch packets: vxvde has been implemented as a module of the libvdeplug library. It does not needany infrustructure other than a well configured IPv4 or IPv6 network supporting IP multicast. VXVDE has a very simple configuration. A valid IP multicast address is enough to configure a "switchless switched" virtual network.</p><p>Unlike VXLAN, VXVDE does not require any Virtual Tunnel End Point (VTEP). Virtual Machines manage their own access to the virtual network. VXVDE unicast packets are mapped on UDP packets traveling on a direct path from the sending virtual machine to the receiving one, without any copy, any packet retransmission or extra header.</p>

SUMMARY:OpenJDK Adoption Group Q&A
DESCRIPTION: <p>There's a ton of stuff going on in OpenJDK, projects, repositories, bug database, experiments. This is a lot of potential fun, but the entrance barrier for newcomers is extremely high, and it's easy to get lost and not enjoy the fun anymore. In order to help people wanting to contribute keep track of this intricate forest of development and find their way out, the Adoption Group was created (http://openjdk.java.net/groups/adoption/).</p><p>This session is an exchange between few of the hackers directly involved with the Adoption Group and the public. We will indeed discuss some of the projects we are currently involved with - like the planned global hack days for jsonp, jigsaw and tools that use jigsaw and http 2.0 with language interoperability - but above all we will answer questions the audience may have in relation to getting involved with OpenJDK, both from a technical perspective and a social one, so that next year you can sit together with us helping even more people to jump on the fun!</p><p>If you need help organising your next hackday, or you are completelylost tying to get started with OpenJDK, this is the session for you!</p>

SUMMARY:What Lies Beneath?: Lessons learned hacking the OpenJDK interpreter/compilers
DESCRIPTION: <p>What really happens to your Java code along the way to becoming machine code?</p><p>Red Hat has been developing an almost pauseless GC for OpenJDK which requires adding read barriers to every object access. We've also developed ARM64 versions of both the server and the client compilers.  This has given us quite a bit of experience with the internals of the various methods of generating machine code inside the JVM.  This talk will start with a brief tour of the various levels of code generation available and then open up the floor for questions from our panel.</p>

SUMMARY:Every pixel hurts
DESCRIPTION: <p>Design is still a pretty closed process, so I started exploring ways of opening the design process, just as the coding process has been fully opened through collaboration tools, community building, pair acceptance and sharing knowledge. The design community does not have a strong collaboration history. But, since the appearance of the latest UX practices, there is an opportunity to fully open up the process, as UX is based on research and more graphic designers are moving into the UX field.</p><p>We already know there is a lack of UX practice in FOSS projects, so this talk is a further exploration on why such a gap exists, and a collection of ideas and tools that could (hopefully) empower both sides to put a bridge over it.</p>

What if your underlying system environment lets you down, but only under rare conditions that you didn't cover in your tests?</p><p>This talk introduces randomised testing as used by projects like Apache Lucene and Elasticsearch based on the Carrotsearch Randomised Testing framework. It has helped uncover (and ultimately fix) a huge number of bugs not only in these project’s source code, but also in the JVM itself which those projects rely on.</p>

SUMMARY:Reinventing the Enlightenment Object System
DESCRIPTION: <p>The Enlightenment project started over 15 years ago, and while it has evolved a lot over the years, its object system has not; this is quite surprising given that almost everything in Enlightenment is represented by objects. Tom, later joined by other Enlightenment developers, has taken upon himself to redesign it, and called the new system Eo. In this talk Tom will describe the main goals they had for Eo, what (and how) they have achieved, how it was received by fellow developers and how it impacted the Enlightenment project as a whole. Tom will also briefly review other C object systems, some of Eo's unique features, and several related projects that were either created to support Eo, had undergone major improvements enabled by it, or owe they existence to Eo.</p>

There are several ways to address this: scale up by using more processes, use Cython, use PyPy, rewrite parts in C, etc.</p><p>However, there are also quite a few things that can be done directly in Python. This talk goes through a number of examples and show cases how sticking to a few idioms can easily enhance the performance of your existing application without having to revert to more complex optimization strategies.</p>

SUMMARY:Interactive routing algorithms in modern PCB design tools
DESCRIPTION: <p>Interactive (a.k.a. push and shove) routing is a key feature of advanced PCB design software, greatly reducing the time it takes to design and modify the board.There is however no literature on the subject available. The presentation will focus on the internals of the router implemented by CERN for the Kicad PCB editor:- efficient routing geometry storage and obstacle detection,- shove &amp; hug algorithm based on octagonal primitives and force propagation,- optimization and trace smoothing techniques,- length tuning and differential pair routing.</p>

SUMMARY:Life without plastic bags
DESCRIPTION: <p>We've grown quite careless about trash in our developed civilization; with the abundance of resources we bring less attention to efficiency and frugality. What about situations when we <em>do</em> need to care about the amount of garbage we produce? Let's take a journey through computer games, Perl 6 internals and bad practices and see what we can squeeze out of it when we really need to.</p>

SUMMARY:Live atomic updates
DESCRIPTION: <p>If you install packages on a running system you need to be careful to not break running software, or leave the filesystem in an invalid state. This is why Android, Baserock, CoreOS and Project atomic do atomic updates for system software. Currently this requires a reboot, so it's an offline atomic update, but if we can solve online atomic updates, there's no need for packages any more.</p>

SUMMARY:Free and open-source software for medical imaging
DESCRIPTION: <p>The amount of medical images that are generated, analyzed and exchanged by hospitals is dramatically increasing. Medical imaging is indeed the first step to the treatment of more and more illnesses, such as cancers or cardiovascular diseases.</p><p>In turn, the data management of clinical images and the administration of the computer network of a medical imaging department imply continuously growing technological challenges. Tasks such as autorouting between imaging modalities, exchanging data between clinical departments or hospitals, or anonymizing images are still hard to achieve in practice. This is a direct consequence of the lack of interoperability software that could bring technological independence to hospitals by creating low-cost gateways between proprietary ecosystems.</p><p>In this talk, I will explain the pains behind modern medical imaging, from the perspective of the hospitals. The DICOM standard will be introduced, together with free and open-source software supporting this standard.</p><p>I will then put emphasis on the free software Orthanc, a lightweight, versatile DICOM server. Thanks to its REST API and to its Lua scripting engine, Orthanc is primarily conceived as a central, robust building block to bring technological independence to clinical departments by automating their very specific imaging flows. Orthanc was nominated at the Zénobe Award 2013 for social innovation.</p>

SUMMARY:Smart VM scheduling in oVirt cluster
DESCRIPTION: <p>The oVirt project allows efficient management of virtualized datacenters. Deciding what machine should host a certain VM is one of the important functions of the management platform. Unfortunately it is also one of the complex ones, because there can be many rules governing the placement policy and there is a time limit in which a VM has to be started or migration initiated. Till now each VM was considered separately and that caused fragmentation of free resources.</p><p>We are about to present a new solution to this issue in this presentation. We have started a cooperation with the OptaPlanner team that develops an optimization engine based on probabilistic (soft computing) algorithms. This means that oVirt will feed situation updates to an optimization service and continuously receive improved solutions back. It will then use the precomputed results for rebalancing the clusters.</p>

SUMMARY:BIFUZ
DESCRIPTION: <p>We have designed and implemented an Intent Fuzzing Framework for Android.Intents are one of the most important ways used by applications to communicate. They benefit also for a very high level of trust inside the Android OS, so if they are not validated appropriate, they might create an unwanted damage, or might even compromise a mobile device, from Security perspective.As a term, fuzzing implies manipulating input data, in order to validate it through the mechanism or device under test. It is usually a black-box, negative testing technique, but we have used it as a grey-box method, also.Knowing how Intents are built, and which type of parameters they accept and expect, we have been able to craft fuzzed Intents, in order to find Security vulnerabilities in the Inter Process Communication protocol.</p>

SUMMARY:Multithreading Made Easy, part 3 - Bounded Work Queues
DESCRIPTION: <p>Ada is one of very few programming languages that supportmultithreading as part of the language, as opposed to libraries.</p><p>In the previous two episodes, we showed how Ada makes it easy to turna single-threaded program into a multi-threaded program. We endedup with ten thousand threads working concurrently then introduceda task pool and work queue wherein a small number of threads (oneper processor core) process thousands of small work units.  But thework queue could become very big.  In this third and last episode,we show how to restrict the size of the work queue to a fixed limit,thereby preventing denial-of-service attacks.</p><p>This presentation will feature live editing of source code, compilationand debugging.  Questions from beginners are encouraged.  It is notnecessary to have attended the first installments.  The sources of ourexample program will be provided to those who want to tinker with them.</p>

SUMMARY:Big Graph Analytics on Neo4j with Apache Spark
DESCRIPTION: <p>In this talk I will introduce you to a Docker container that provides you an easy way to do distributed graph processing using Apache Spark GraphX and a Neo4j graph database. You'll learn how to analyze big data graphs that are exported from Neo4j and consequently updated from the results of a Spark GraphX analysis. The types of analysis I will be talking about are PageRank, connected components, triangle counting, and community detection.</p>

SUMMARY:Superoptimization
DESCRIPTION: <p>Modern compiler optimization can take almost any code and produce a reasonably efficient binary at the end. However compiler "optimization" doesn't make your code "optimal", just better.</p><p>In contrast, superoptimization can produce perfect code - the fastest, the smallest or the most energy efficient code. The technique, first introduced in the late 80s found in some cases it could do 25% better than the best assembly programmer, and 40% better than the best compiler at the time.</p><p>Free software has always played a central role in superoptimization research, with the GNU Superoptimizer being one of the very first tools constructed.</p><p>However there is a downside. Superoptimization today is incredibly demanding of compute time, so currently it is limited to short instruction sequences. At present it is most valuable in optimizing code hotspots and key library routines, and can also be a valuable aid to the compiler writer for peephole optimization. Recent research has developed new techniques that can make superoptimization more applicable to general code.</p><p>In this talk I will introduce superoptimization and give some examples of the weird and wonderfully short sequences of code it produces. I will introduce the GNU superoptimizer and show how it is used, including some of the recent improvements I have contributed. The final part of my talk will look at the latest research including machine learning and constraint solving, and show how in future superoptimizers may be able to optimize much larger programs.</p>

SUMMARY:Large Scale Quality Assurance in the PostgreSQL Ecosystem
DESCRIPTION: <p>The apt.postgresql.org repository hosts PostgreSQL server packages for seven major releases: all the stable branches plus beta and the devel versions. Targetting two architectures and seven Debian and Ubuntu releases, this is almost 100 combinations in the cross product. On top of that, we build binary packages for various PostgreSQL extensions and applications. Of course no one is able to test thousands of packages manually.</p><p>We are putting much effort into running regression tests on all extensions using pg_regress, and creating system integration tests to be run with the autopkgtest tool. All tests are integrated with our Jenkins build server.</p><p>This talk presents recent advances made in the area and includes examples of bugs found.</p>

SUMMARY:(Re)discovering SPL
DESCRIPTION: <p>The Standard PHP Library (SPL) might be one of the most powerful, yet the most unused part of PHP, but you are one of those lucky developers who have discovered it! But now what? The lack of documentation about SPL makes it that a lot users don't really harvest the power that SPL brings. During this presentation I will dive into the numerous iterators, data-structures and interfaces that SPL defines and when &amp; how to implement them in your own projects, but we will talk about the edge-cases as well, as in SPL land things don't always are what they seem..</p>

SUMMARY:NTF's General Timestamp API and Library
DESCRIPTION: <p>A good timestamp can be a very useful thing.  Unfortunately, most current timestamps don't have enough information in them to be very useful, and they don't "age well"' and are too often not useful outside of the context of where they were taken.  After decades of casual thought, Harlan started to document what information would be needed to have a useful timestamp, and what sort of underlying support would be necessary to produce and use them.  This turned in to a GSoC project in  2013 where a proof-of-concept user-level library was produced, and some work was done to implement the new timestamp format as a core kernel timekeeping structure in a Linux kernel.</p>

We have been able to successfully bootstrap GlusterFS in the Storage SIG. Relevant RPMs have been build for the SIG using the new CentOS build system. During the last couple of months of bootstrapping GlusterFS in the storage SIG we have faced some technical challenges which will be applicable to other SIGs (current and Future). During this talk we will share our experiences and discuss the technical challenges GlusterFS faced, how we solved it and the thought process around it. In this talk we will also talk about how Storage SIG is trying to give best upstream experience to community/users.</p>

SUMMARY:The power of cross-correlating: from GPS reception to passive RADAR using SDR
DESCRIPTION: <p>CDMA systems rely on encoding data streams radiated by multiple emitters on the same carrier frequency with (ideally) orthogonal codes. Recovering the signal from each emitter requires identifying the code assiociated witheach source, which hence also requires recovering the carrier to account for relative emitter/receiver motion (Doppler shift), thermal drift and oscillator bias. We demonstrate this concept with the reception of GPS signal -- a constellation of satellites orbiting 20000 km over the surface of the earth -- with 20 euro worth of equipment centered on a DVB-T receiver designed for receiving neighbouring television signals. We extend the concept to passive radar, in which a radiofrequency emitter (television, broadcast radio) signal reflected on a mobile target is used for identifying the velocity and position of the target. In this approach, no active source is needed: RADAR measurement is only a matter of correlating the direct and reflected signal, after identifying the Doppler induced frequency shift.</p>

SUMMARY:Utilizing NUMA architecture in oVirt
DESCRIPTION: <p>For several years now, the oVirt project is leveraging KVM and relevant technologies (ksm, etc) in data center virtualizations. Being a matureand feature reach, oVirt takes another step forward with introducing NUMA architecture support which will allow better utilization of hypervisorsin advanced virtual data centres. Different NUMA implementations and insights on use cases will allow participants to gain more knowledge on howto optimize their existing hypervisors in the virt world.</p>

SUMMARY:LibreOffice and ODF
DESCRIPTION: <p>Open Document Format (ODF) is the native file format of LibreOffice. It means that all features of the document model must be represented at the ODF level, too. The features, which cannot be represented in ODF version 1.2, need to be submitted to OASIS to be included in the next version of the standard. My talk gives an overview of recent work and plans of the LibreOffice project related to ODF standardization.</p>

SUMMARY:Matrix.org - a new open standard for distributed, real-time communication
DESCRIPTION: <p>Matrix is a new, pragmatic HTTP-based clean-room alternative to XMPP, SIP, IRC and other messaging/VoIP technologies. It consists of an open standard defining RESTful HTTP APIs and open source, Apache-licensed reference implementations for creating and running your own real-time communication infrastructure.</p><p>Our hope is to make VoIP/IM as universal and interoperable as email, and build an open ecosystem that people can use for a multitude of purposes.</p>

SUMMARY:Perl's Syntactic Legacy
DESCRIPTION: <p>The Perl programming language is currently enjoying a resurgence in popularity, and for good reason!Perl 5 development continues to move forward with new features being introduced and many old ones improved, meanwhile the development of Perl 6 is making significant progress and has reached a major milestone, the details of which will be announced by Larry Wall at this very conference.For many years now the development of these sister languages have affected and influenced one another in a myriad of ways. Over the last few years I have been working on a design proposal for enhancing and extending the object system of Perl 5 which borrows a number of elements from the Perl 6 object system.In this talk we will explore the various evolutionary stages of that work, as well as discuss the complexities of adding new features to such a mature and well established language like Perl 5. Along the way we will also examine the various meanings of "legacy" in each context and show how it informed the design decisions that were made.</p>

SUMMARY:hardware switches - the opensource approach
DESCRIPTION: <p>Imagine buying off the shelf switch hardware, install Fedora (or any otherdistribution) and configure it using standard linux tools. This is notpossible at the moment primarily because of lack of unified and consistentplatforms and driver interfaces. We are working to change that.</p><p>The current state of support for switch chips in Linux is not good. Eachvendor provides userspace binary sdk blob that only works with theirchips. Each of this blobs has proprietary APIs. To get switch chipsproperly supported there's need to introduce a new infrastructure directlyinto Linux kernel and to work with vendors to adopt it.</p><p>This talk presents the current effort to unify and uphold the Linuxnetworking model across the spectrum of devices which is necessary to makeLinux the cornerstone of industrial grade networking. The scope of thistalk covers state of art with current implementation of standard commodityswitches such as top of rack switches, small home gateway device as wellas SR-IOV NIC embedded switches.</p><p>A device model and driver infrastructure will be presented foraccelerating the Linux bridge, Linux router, accelerated host virtualswitches and flow level offloads when supported by the hardwareunderneath.</p>

SUMMARY:The Typed Index
DESCRIPTION: <p>Besides issues of scaling your search, there are very important aspects concerning search-quality that should not be neglected. Search-quality is mainly controlled by analysis and query parsing. I will talk about frequent problems concerning Lucene analysis and I will show on several examples that usually one analyzer (normal form) is not sufficient, even in a mono-lingual environment but especially in multilingual environments. I will show how our typed index approach allows to solve many of these problems and how we plan to properly treat even mixed-language documents based on this approach.</p>

SUMMARY:Copyleft in Europe: How does copyleft interact with Exhaustion Of Rights
DESCRIPTION: <p>Copyleft licences work by conditioning distribution of a work's binary on providing access to relevant source code. Under the European Computer Programs directive, once a copy of a computer program has been placed in circulation in the EEA by or with the consent of the copyright holder, the copyright holder can no longer control circulation ("exhaustion of rights"). Is the condition to provide source an attempt to control circulation, and is the exhaustion principle problematic for the GPL and other copyleft licences? Commentators have suggested that this is fatal to copyleft, but we argue these analyses are overblown.</p>

SUMMARY:Yatta: A Real-Time Framework for Peer-to-peer Group Editing on Arbitrary Data Types
DESCRIPTION: <p>Yatta is an open source framework that can be used to collaborate in real-time on arbitrary data types. It is based on a new operational transformation-like approach that can be used in peer-to-peer settings on the Web, using standard communication protocols such as WebRTC or XMPP. Part of the shared editing projects family (e.g. ShareJs, OpenCoweb, etc.), Yatta currently implements support for text, XML and JSON and proved to be very fast and reliable.In this lightning talk we introduce the concepts and features of the Yatta framework and discuss how it can be leveraged to design the next generation of peer-to-peer shared editing tools. We conclude the talk with a short demo that highlights the capabilities of the framework.</p>

SUMMARY:CentOS Virt SIG
DESCRIPTION: <p>CentOS is a "distribution" with a rather unique description: it is a free (gratis) clone of a commercially-supported "distribution" with all the branding removed.  Being enterprise-grade distribution means solid and well-tested; but it also means not having the latest functionality.  It also means having a small enough feature set to provide commercial support in a viable manner: and that typically means choosing one technology and sticking with it.</p><p>But what if you wanted your entire system to be solid, and well-tested, but want the latest features for one particular package or program?  Or what if you really wanted an enterprise system, but wanted to use one of the alternate technoligies that were not selected?</p><p>This is where CentOS SIGs come in.  The new CentOS is still at its core a clone of an upstream enterprise distribution.  But having had success with the Xen4CentOS project, which provided a version of Xen to run on CentOS 6, they have now generalized the process.</p><p>This talk will talk about CentOS SIGs: the vision, the structure, what SIGs are available. We will compare and contrast them to other community distro development models like Fedora, OpenSuSE, Debian, Ubuntu, and so forth.  We will also share lessons from the CentOS Virt SIG, in which a number of virtualisation and related technologies such as Xen, oVirt, Docker and others collaborate.</p>

SUMMARY:Open source home automation
DESCRIPTION: <p>There are 3 problems with close source home automations systems. i. These systems tend to be ridiculously expensive for the features that they offer, since most vendors target the high-end market segment with customized solutions. ii. Configuring and maintaining the system has to be done by a certified installer, giving the customer little control over their own house. iii. Theses systems use closed-source communication protocols and you -as a user- are not able to interface with the system or change anything in the system.</p><p>OpenMotics is an open source home automation hardware and software system that offers features like switching lights and outputs, multi-zone heating and cooling, power measurements, and automated actions. The system encompases both open source software and hardware. For interoperability with other systems, the OpenMotics Gateway provides an API through which various actions can be executed. The project was open sourced 2 years ago and was started about 10 years. The choice to open source the project was very conscious: we want to offer a system where users are in full control over their home automation system.</p>

Peter Kelly decided earlier this year to make his editor open source (Thanks), and we rapidly built a community around it. Corinthia is firstly a toolkit for document format conversion, that ffacilitates round trip conversion without data loss. The engine us a complete new idea comming from desktop editors like LO and AOO. The idea of the editor is not to replace a full fledged desktop editor, but merely to let you correct minor things when you discuss your work with friends wich of course happens on a tablet.</p>

SUMMARY:Enabling video preservation through open source
DESCRIPTION: <p>Exactly what codecs and containers should be favored in audiovisual preservation is an ongoing debate with archives while broadcast industries, media production industries, and increasingly open source communities contributing technology that supports the objectives of audiovisual preservation. As the machinery and skills needed to sustain access to film and analog video collections decay it is increasingly urgent for archives to address blocking technological issues in order to re-format legacy audiovisual recordings to digital formats efficiently. The presentation reviews the requirements and demands on technology within audiovisual preservation projects and assesses the opportunities and concerns of open media to contribute to preservation challenges, with a focus on lossless audiovisual codecs, technical and contextual metadata, and both the openness and standardization of relevant file formats.</p>

SUMMARY:Towards legal criteria for best practices in free software/open source development
DESCRIPTION: <p>This talk will propose several ideas for inclusion in a set of modernlegal standards for good practices in FLOSS development and governancebeyond the traditional emphasis on software freedom-conformant sourcecode licensing. The theme will be maximizing diverse, egalitarian andauthentically meritocratic participation, minimizing legalimpediments, and avoiding distortion or corruption by powerful projectstakeholders. Ideas to be discussed include distributed andsymmetrical copyright licensing, fair trademark policies, appropriateapproaches to patent nonassertion by corporate participants, andcommitments by projects or associated foundations to promoting diverseand safe environments for development work.</p><p>Ideas discussed in this talk may form the basis for work done by theOpen Source Initiative during the coming year.</p>

SUMMARY:How to test OpenGL drivers using Free Software
DESCRIPTION: <p>OpenGL is an API for rendering 2D and 3D graphics now managed by the non-profit technology consortium Khronos Group. Implementors are free to provide their own implementation of the API. For example, in GNU/Linux systems NVIDIA provides its own proprietary version while other manufacturers like Intel are using Mesa, the most popular open source OpenGL implementation.</p><p>Because of this implementation freedom, ensuring compliance with the specification is important. Khronos provides their own OpenGL conformance test suite but there are several unofficial open source alternatives.</p><p>This talk will explain some of these open source OpenGL conformance test suites and give an introduction about how to use them, including sharing tips between the speaker and the audience.</p>

SUMMARY:Why we tried (and ignored) famous IaaS to deliver SecurePass
DESCRIPTION: <p>Our question was: "what is the best infrastructure to run our SaaS on?".We tried most of the infrastructure software, starting from vmware, moving to Proxmox, OpenNebula, OpenStack, and Google's Ganeti. We also considered software storage and software defined networks. We mastered some of these technologies and we even contributed to the projects. But we felt we needed something different and lighter and we "blended" our own solution, mixing and matching the best of the above and keeping in consideration our needs in terms of computing, network and storage. This talk will go through our (long) journey, understanding pros and cons of each technology and describing what we used to deliver SecurePass and other services.</p>

SUMMARY:Consuming Open Source Configuration
DESCRIPTION: <p>Infrastructure and configuration are now being represented as code. This code is then put into git repositories, OSI approved licenses are attached, and the code published. This creates an Open Source project. There are several instances of this now: OpenStack, Mozilla, Wikimedia, and Jenkins all have open sourced their infrastructure. It is, however, relatively easy to say "our configuration is totally open source, anyone can use it", and it is actually much harder to actively consume someone else's configuration. My team consumes one of these open source configuration projects and sits downstream from it. I will present on we're doing, what has worked, what hasn't, and what we're going to do next. I'm going to give actionable advice for people who are consuming or want to be consuming another organization's open source infrastructure, and I'll be providing some feedback to those who are currently open sourcing their infrastructure on how to make it easier to consume.</p>

However, logic programming in and of itself has much to teach us about approaches to systems - taking declarative system descriptions to a new level of abstraction, and finding ways to integrate these ideas back into more common workflows.From Prolog to Erlang to Haskell to Lisp to TLC and then back to Prolog I have journeyed, and I'd like to share some of the beautiful and brilliant things I've discovered along the way and why I think they might make us better operations geeks.And when approaching new languages, always remember: You can't scare us, we've used m4.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>Since the late 1980s, the discipline of network management has kept up well enough with virtual notions in networks while continuing to rely heavily on the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). The rise of software-defined networks poses similar challenges to the ones brought to the systems management space by server virtualization and cloud computing, leaving practitioners to wonder how much retooling will be needed to cope in this new world.</p><p>As the oldest enterprise-grade, open-source network management platform, OpenNMS has proved fairly adaptable so far. This talk will cover where we've been, what's possible given today's realities, and what we expect will be the toughest challenges in the future.</p>

SUMMARY:Adapting Apache OpenOffice for adoption in a public administration: configuration, Sharepoint webdav integration and an extension to help users exchange ODF files
DESCRIPTION: <p>This talk aims to give an overview of the introduction of the ODF standard and Apache OpenOffice in an Italian public administration with more than 3000 users, addressing briefly the main technical issues and solutions. In particular we will talk about: 1) the configuration of OpenOffice, extended with community developed and custom extensions to help users in the everyday work 2) the interoperability with Sharepoint through the webdav protocol and what we developed in Apache OpenOffice for the correct interaction 3) our extension to simplify picking the right format for file exchange, to answer the users' ubiquitous question "Ok but… should I use ODF to send/share this?”, in relation to our ODF census project in Italy.</p>

SUMMARY:Building Economic Simulations in Ada
DESCRIPTION: <p>Virtual Worlds Research has been using Ada to build large scaleeconomic simulations for 10 years now.  These simulations have beenused by Governments and others to model the effects of, amongstother things, changing Legal Aid and reforming Social Care funding- many billions of pounds of annual spending.  Here, I discuss ourexperiences, good and bad, with the Ada language, and provide a livedemonstration of the most recent model.  I'll also discuss work inprogress to build a new forecasting model in association with theUniversity of Southampton.</p>

SUMMARY:Crazyflie Nano Quadcopter
DESCRIPTION: <p>In 2009 three Swedish engineers invented a small quadcopter that started with a simple idea: get an electronic board (PCB) to fly.They created the "Crazyflie Nano Quadcopter" which weighs only 19g and fits in the palm of your hand. It can be controlled from various devices, including PC, Android or iOS devices, Raspberry Pi or a R/C remote.While the main client has been written in Python, it has also been ported to Java, C, JavaScript.Since the beginning of 2013 the hardware can be bought from http://www.seeedstudio.com, but the schematics for the PCB and the firmware/host source code are also available on their website/Github account.Due to the low cost for the hardware and the open source approach, the Crazyflie has been used in different private and academic science and research projects around the world.</p>

SUMMARY:Open Heart Surgery: HotSpot Debugging at the OS Level
DESCRIPTION: <p>Debugging Java applications is comfortable and simple, but if you want to look beyond the Java horizon, you need special knowledge and and different tools.</p><p>This interactive session shows you how to debug a running VM or analyze a VM core file with a native debugger like gdb. You will also learn how to use some of the more than 1,200 VM options to trace ormodify the VM behavior. This knowledge can greatly help you identify, isolate and reproduce the root cause of hard VM crashes, and it can also be pure fun to see which actual machine instruction the CPU is executing for your Java code.</p>

SUMMARY:Fork and Ignore: Fighting a GPL Violation By Coding Instead
DESCRIPTION: <p>Typically, GPL enforcement activity involves copyright infringement actions which compel license violators to correct errors in their GPL compliance,thus yielding the policy goals of the GPL: the rights of developers and users to copy, share, modify and redistribute.</p><p>While traditional enforcement is often undeniably necessary for embedded electronics products, novel approaches to GPL violations are often possible and even recommended for more traditional software distributions.</p><p>Recently, Conservancy engaged in an enforcement action whereby,rather than fight the violator in court, Conservancy instead fostered and provide resources and assistance to a vetted GPL-compliant fork of a violating codebase.</p><p>This talk discusses which scenarios make this remedy optimal and lessons learned. The talk includes some licensing and technical content about vetting licensing information of codebases.</p>

SUMMARY:Perl 6: beyond dynamic vs. static
DESCRIPTION: <p>Is Perl 6 dynamic? Well, it sure looks like it: you can eval code at runtime, do all kinds of late-bound lookups, write code without a type declaration in sight, dynamically generate types, and even mutate the language and the way its object model works.But hang on a moment! Misspell a variable or object attribute? That's a compile time error. Call a subroutine that doesn't exist? Yup, same deal. Passing just one argument to a sub that needs two? There's a good chance you'll be told about that too...at compile time. Want to write code that uses native integers and floating point numbers? Go right ahead and throw in some types. Oh, and those super-dynamic modules that extend the language? They can get in on the act, and flag up things to the programmer at compile time too!In this session, we'll explore how Perl 6 strikes a balance between static and dynamic, how the Rakudo Perl 6 compiler takes advantage of this careful design work, and how the language and implementation are flexible enough to let the programmer pick their own trade-offs if the defaults don't fit their problem.</p>

SUMMARY:Discrimination & Reciprocity
DESCRIPTION: <p>Termination provisions are a standard component of license agreements. FOSS licenses and FRAND commitments, however, are not standard agreements, as they are founded on ideals of non-discrimination. Termination clauses, which permit licensors to cancel rights of specific licensees, contradict these ideals. The talk will clarify the contradictions between these principles and license termination provisions, explain why termination provisions are nonetheless justified in these models, and illustrate these explanations by reference to a number of current debates.</p>

SUMMARY:Monitoring As A Service
DESCRIPTION: <p>Building a modern monitoring environment is more than just using the latest awesome tools, collecting all of the data, displaying numerous graphs and knowing when things go wrong. A modern monitoring environment is more than tools and infrastructure. It's a service. A service you provide to your whole team: developers, operations, security, and the business. This talk is about how you can build monitoring environments (or extend your existing environment) that are customer-focussed rather than infrastructure focussed. We'll see how you can treat your needs and the needs of your organization as customer requirements and build monitoring that is consumable and configurable on demand.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>Compact C Type Format (CTF) is a technology created during development of theD-Trace software to describe the C data types. With its second version itevolved into a fully expressive, yet space-wise efficient format that can beused outside of the D-Trace suite too. Compiling the FreeBSD kernel with theCDDL/CTF option triggers the creation of such CTF data that corresponds to therespective kernel objects. This dataset can be parsed and processed to become asource of information needed to pretty print all kernel data structures insidethe on-line kernel debugger DDB.</p>
